## Stat Increases Per Level

### Base Stats Growth

Example (Option 2 - Specialized):
Level 5 stats: STR 12, DEX 14, CON 13, INT 18, WIS 17, CHA 10

MP: +10 per level (+INT or WIS modifier)
SP: +8 per level (+highest physical stat modifier)

Example (CON 13 = +1, INT 18 = +4, DEX 14 = +2):
Level 4 ‚Üí 5:
HP: 145 + 15 + 1 = 161
MP: 220 + 10 + 4 = 234

## Multi-Classing (Optional Rule)

### Requirements

‚Ä¢ Stealth (Rogue)

Unique Synergy:
"Silent Savior" - Heal allies from stealth without revealing position

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå WRONG
```
"You defeated the enemies. You level up!"
(No XP shown, unclear why leveling happened)
```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT
```
"You defeated 3 goblins (Level 2).
XP: 3 √ó 200 = 600 XP awarded.

Current XP: 8,200 / 8,500 to Level 4.

You're 300 XP away from leveling up!"
```

---

### ‚ùå WRONG
```
"You learned a new spell somehow."
(No explanation of why/how skill was learned)
```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT
```
"You've reached Level 5!

Choose 1 new skill:
A) Advanced Healing
B) Life Barrier  
C) Purify

[Player chooses A]

‚úÖ Skill Learned: Advanced Healing
Added to character sheet. You can now use this in combat."
```
