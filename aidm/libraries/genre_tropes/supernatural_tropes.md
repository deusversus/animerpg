# Supernatural & Occult Anime Genre Tropes

**Purpose**: Frameworks for supernatural anime—esper powers, spirit world mechanics, exorcism, yokai/spirits, psychic abilities, supernatural investigation, and the intersection of mundane with otherworldly.

**Coverage**: Esper/psychic powers, spirit world systems, yokai/ghost mechanics, exorcism rituals, supernatural investigation, occult organizations, spiritual balance, mediums/seers, curse mechanics, divine/demonic entities

**Use When**: Psychic ability campaigns, spirit detective arcs, yokai encounters, exorcism missions, supernatural slice-of-life, occult mysteries, spiritual warfare, modern fantasy settings

---

## Core Philosophy

**Principles**:
- **Mundane Meets Mystical**: Normal world has hidden supernatural layer (only some can see)
- **Power = Burden**: Supernatural abilities come with cost (isolation, responsibility, danger)
- **Spirits Have Agency**: Ghosts/yokai not just monsters (personalities, motives, tragic pasts)
- **Balance is Fragile**: Spiritual equilibrium maintained, disruption = catastrophe
- **Rules Govern Supernatural**: Even magic has logic (contracts, hierarchies, weaknesses)

**Supernatural Spectrum**:
- **Psychic Powers** (Mob Psycho 100, Saiki K): ESP, telekinesis, telepathy, esper battles
- **Spirit World** (Noragami, Natsume's Book of Friends): Gods, yokai, ayakashi, spirit realm
- **Exorcism/Purification** (Blue Exorcist, Jujutsu Kaisen): Demon hunting, curse removal, holy powers
- **Mediums/Seers** (Mushishi adjacent): See spirits, mediate between worlds, spiritual balance
- **Urban Fantasy** (Durarara!!, Bungo Stray Dogs): Modern city + supernatural underground

## Psychic/Esper Archetypes

### The Overpowered Psychic (Mob, Saiki K)
**Profile**: Godlike powers but hates using them, wants normal life
**Abilities**: Telekinesis, telepathy, levitation, exorcism, reality warping
**Conflict**: Power isolates them, can't relate to normals, terrified of losing control
**Gameplay**: Broken abilities (can win any encounter) BUT player motivated to avoid using them
**Examples**: Mob (Mob Psycho), Saiki (Saiki K), Tatsumaki (One Punch Man)

### The Struggling Esper
**Profile**: Has powers but limited, must train/grow to compete
**Abilities**: One or two psychic disciplines (telekinesis OR telepathy, not both)
**Conflict**: Outclassed by stronger espers, must compensate with tactics/creativity
**Gameplay**: Standard progression (powers grow with levels)
**Examples**: Sho (Mob Psycho side character), Teru before Mob encounter

### The Spirit Medium
**Profile**: Sees ghosts/spirits, mediates between living and dead
**Abilities**: Spirit sight, exorcism, channeling, spiritual contracts
**Conflict**: Burden of seeing death, spirits seek them out, can't ignore suffering
**Gameplay**: Non-combat support (detect spirits, negotiate, purify) OR battle exorcist
**Examples**: Natsume (Natsume's Book of Friends), Reigen (Mob Psycho - fake medium who learns)

### The Cursed Vessel
**Profile**: Possessed by powerful entity (demon, god, spirit)
**Abilities**: Host can channel entity's power (often reluctantly)
**Conflict**: Lose control = entity takes over, constant internal battle
**Gameplay**: Risk/reward powers (strong but dangerous, possession checks)
**Examples**: Rin (Blue Exorcist - Satan's son), Yato (Noragami - technically god not cursed)

## Spirit World Mechanics

### Yokai & Ayakashi (Natsume, Noragami, Mushishi)

**Types**:
- **Harmless Spirits**: Nature yokai (forest guardians, river spirits), mostly peaceful
- **Mischievous**: Pranksters (hide objects, create illusions, minor inconvenience)
- **Dangerous**: Predatory spirits (feed on humans, possess victims, cause death)
- **Ancient Powers**: God-tier yokai (regional deities, catastrophic if angered)

**Behavior Patterns**:
- **Territorial**: Bound to location (shrine, forest, river), hostile to intruders
- **Contract-Based**: Obey rules (Natsume returns names, yokai owe favors)
- **Emotional**: React to feelings (kindness pacifies, disrespect enrages)
- **Forgotten Gods**: Lose power when humans stop worship (Noragami's pantheon)

**Interaction Rules**:
- **Names Have Power**: Knowing true name grants control (Natsume's Book)
- **Offerings**: Food, sake, incense appease spirits
- **Respect**: Bow to shrine, thank forest, apologize for intrusion
- **Visibility**: Most humans can't see yokai (only spiritually sensitive)

### Spirit Realm vs Material World

**Dual Layer Reality**:
- **Visible Layer**: Normal world (humans, physics, mundane)
- **Hidden Layer**: Spirit world (yokai, gods, supernatural)
- **Seers**: Can perceive both (source of isolation—see things others don't)

**Crossover Mechanics**:
- **Thin Places**: Locations where veil is weak (shrines, graveyards, old forests)
- **Midnight Hour**: Time when spirit activity peaks (Noragami's Far Shore)
- **Rituals**: Ceremonies open gates (summoning, exorcism, divine descent)
- **Near-Death**: Humans approaching death can see spirits (Noragami's near-shore)

### Gods & Divine Hierarchy (Noragami)

**Pantheon Structure**:
- **Major Gods**: Worshipped widely (Bishamon, Tenjin), immense power
- **Minor Gods**: Few followers (Yato), struggle to survive
- **Forgotten Gods**: Lost all worship, fade from existence

**Divine Mechanics**:
- **Worship = Power**: Prayers strengthen gods, forgotten = death
- **Shinki**: Gods' weapons (spirits of dead humans bound to service)
- **Corruption**: Negative emotions create Phantoms (spiritual parasites)
- **Divine Politics**: Gods scheme against each other, alliances, rivalries

---

## Curse Mechanics

3. **Perform Ritual**: Specific countermeasure (offering, exorcism, sacrifice)
4. **Resolve Grudge**: Address original wrong (apologize to ghost, right injustice)

**Costs**:
- **Transfer Curse**: Can move to volunteer (someone must bear it)
- **Equivalent Exchange**: Breaking curse costs something equal (lifespan, memories, power)
- **Permanent Mark**: Curse leaves scar (physical or spiritual)

---

## Supernatural Organizations

### Exorcist Orders (Blue Exorcist, Jujutsu Kaisen)

**Structure**:
- **Hierarchical**: Ranked exorcists (novice → veteran → master)
- **Specialized**: Different divisions (research, combat, sealing)
- **Political**: Internal factions, power struggles, corruption
- **Secretive**: Hidden from normal society (Vatican equivalent)

**Resources**:
- **Blessed Weapons**: Holy swords, enchanted guns, demon-slaying tools
- **Ancient Knowledge**: Demon catalogs, ritual libraries, forbidden techniques
- **Safe Houses**: Sanctified locations demons can't enter
- **Support Network**: Healers, researchers, logistics

### Spirit Mediation Services (Mob Psycho, Noragami)

**Business Model**:
- **For Hire**: Solve hauntings, exorcise possessions, curse removal
- **Sliding Scale**: Rich pay more, poor get discounts, some pro bono
- **Reputation**: Word of mouth, success rate, discretion

**Challenges**:
- **Fakes**: Charlatans claim powers they lack (Reigen initially)
- **Competition**: Rival exorcists, turf wars
- **Danger**: Spirits fight back, curses backlash, clients lie

---

## Spiritual Balance & Consequences

### Ecosystem Dynamics

**Balance Principle**:
- **Too Many Spirits**: Overrun material world (Noragami's Phantom outbreaks)
- **Too Few Spirits**: Nature suffers, divine protection fades
- **Human Impact**: Development destroys spirit habitats (Mushishi's ecological themes)

**Disruption Consequences**:
- **Phantom Storms**: Corrupted spirits swarm (Noragami)
- **Divine Withdrawal**: Gods abandon humans (Noragami's forgotten gods)
- **Curse Spread**: Unchecked curses metastasize (Jujutsu Kaisen's cursed womb)

### Moral Complexity

**Not All Spirits Are Evil**:
- **Tragic Ghosts**: Died wrongly, seek justice or closure
- **Protective Yokai**: Guard forests, rivers, villages
- **Neutral Entities**: Just exist, don't harm unless provoked

**Exorcist Dilemmas**:
- **Kill Innocent Spirit?**: Ordered to exorcise harmless ghost (obey or rebel?)
- **Curse Has Reason**: Victim deserved curse (lift it anyway?)
- **Become Monster**: Use dark powers to fight darkness (ends justify means?)

---

## Psychic Phenomena

### Precognition/Clairvoyance

**Abilities**:
- **Future Sight**: See possible futures (often vague, symbolic)
- **Remote Viewing**: See distant locations
- **Postcognition**: See past events (psychometry - touch object to see history)
- **Death Sense**: Know when someone will die (can't prevent, just know)

**Costs**:
- **Madness**: Seeing too much breaks mind
- **Paralysis**: Know future but can't change it (determinism horror)
- **Targeted**: Enemies aware you can see them

### Astral Projection/Spirit Walking

**Capabilities**:
- **Soul Separate**: Leave body, travel as spirit
- **Spirit Realm Access**: Enter Far Shore, meet gods/yokai
- **Invisibility**: Normals can't see astral form
- **Intangibility**: Pass through walls, objects

**Risks**:
- **Body Vulnerable**: Physical form defenseless (need guardian)
- **Lost**: Can't find way back to body (trapped as ghost)
- **Attacked**: Spirits/demons can fight astral form
- **Time Limit**: Too long = body dies, soul stranded

## Core Themes

**What Makes Supernatural Anime Great**:
- **Hidden World**: Mundane hides mystical (only special people see truth)
- **Power = Isolation**: Abilities separate from normal life (Mob, Saiki, Natsume)
- **Spirits Have Stories**: Yokai/ghosts are characters not just monsters
- **Balance Matters**: Spiritual ecosystem requires maintenance
- **Responsibility**: Power comes with duty (protect balance, help spirits, fight evil)

**AIDM Guidance**:
- **Layer Worlds**: Normal surface + hidden supernatural (perception checks reveal)
- **Spirits Speak**: Give yokai/ghosts personalities, motives, tragic pasts (not mindless)
- **Cost Powers**: Psychic abilities isolate, burden, endanger users
- **Negotiation Option**: Combat not always answer (peaceful resolution possible)
- **Balance Consequences**: Disrupting spirit world has ecological ripple effects

**Make Players Feel Wonder**: The moment they first see spirit world, the awe of meeting ancient yokai, the responsibility of mediating between worlds, the burden of knowing what others can't see, the tragedy of a ghost's unfinished business. These moments should blend mystery, beauty, melancholy, and power. That's supernatural anime magic.
