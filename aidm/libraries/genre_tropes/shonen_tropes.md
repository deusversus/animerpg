---

## Core Shonen Philosophy

### The Shonen Protagonist

**Defining Traits**:
- **Unwavering Determination**: Never gives up, no matter the odds
- **Simple Morals**: Clear sense of right/wrong, protects friends
- **Hidden Potential**: Starts weak/average, becomes strongest through effort
- **Loud & Energetic**: Passionate, declares dreams loudly
- **Inspires Others**: Charisma that changes people's hearts

**Common Protagonist Types**:
1. **The Underdog** (Deku, Asta): No/weak power, compensates with strategy & heart
2. **The Prodigy** (Gon, Luffy): Natural talent, unconventional thinking
3. **The Chosen One** (Naruto, Ichigo): Destiny/bloodline, but earned through struggle
4. **The Hot-Blooded Idiot** (Goku, Natsu): Simple-minded, pure fighting instinct

**AIDM Guidance**:
```markdown
Shonen protagonist succeeds through:
- Training harder than others (montage sequences)
- Clever strategy (outsmarting stronger foes)
- Emotional breakthroughs (rage/love power-ups)
- Friendship bonds (allies lend strength)
- Never surrendering (willpower overcomes limits)

**NOT** through:
- Instant mastery without effort
- Giving up when outmatched
- Betraying friends for power
```

## Shonen Narrative Structures

### The Training Arc (修行)

**Purpose**: Power-up through disciplined practice, mentor guidance, or harsh environment

**Training Arc Types**:

#### 1. **Time-Skip Training**
- **Setup**: Timeskip (months/years) between arcs
- **Reveal**: Protagonist returns dramatically stronger
- **Examples**: Naruto Shippuden (2.5 years), One Piece post-Marineford (2 years)
- **AIDM**: `"Fast-forward 6 months. You've trained relentlessly. What did you focus on?"`

#### 2. **Gravity/Environmental Training**
- **Setup**: Train in harsh conditions (gravity room, waterfall, mountain)
- **Effect**: Builds strength, endurance, mental fortitude
- **Examples**: Dragon Ball hyperbolic time chamber, Demon Slayer mountain training
- **AIDM**: Describe environment, demand endurance checks, show gradual improvement

#### 3. **Mentor-Student Arc**
- **Setup**: Wise master teaches protagonist secret technique
- **Phases**: 
  - Basics (meditation, stance, control)
  - Frustration (can't grasp concept)
  - Breakthrough (emotional insight unlocks technique)
  - Mastery (surpass or equal mentor)
- **Examples**: Jiraiya training Naruto (Rasengan), All Might training Deku
- **AIDM**: Mentor gives cryptic advice, player struggles, "aha!" moment unlocks skill

#### 4. **Survival Training**
- **Setup**: Thrown into dangerous situation, must adapt or die
- **Effect**: Rapid growth under pressure (accelerated model)
- **Examples**: Hunter Exam (Hunter x Hunter), U.A. entrance exam (My Hero Academia)
- **AIDM**: High-stakes challenge, multiple attempts allowed, show visible improvement

**Training Arc Structure** (3-5 sessions):
```
Session 1: Introduction to training, initial failure
Session 2: Struggle montage, small breakthroughs
Session 3: Major obstacle, emotional low point
Session 4: Breakthrough moment (new technique unlocked)
Session 5: Demonstrate new power in real combat
```

---

### The Tournament Arc (トーナメント)

**Purpose**: Showcase cast abilities, introduce rivals, escalate power levels in controlled environment

**Tournament Structures**:

#### 1. **Single-Elimination Bracket**
- **Format**: Win or go home (Chunin Exams, U.A. Sports Festival)
- **Drama**: Underdogs advance via strategy, powerhouses clash
- **AIDM**: Generate bracket, narrate key fights, player fights 3-4 matches

#### 2. **Survival/Battle Royale**
- **Format**: Last one standing or objective-based (Hunter Exam Phase 4)
- **Drama**: Alliances form and break, environment hazards
- **AIDM**: Multiple threats, player chooses who to fight/avoid

#### 3. **Tag Team/Team Battles**
- **Format**: Squad vs squad (Chunin Exams Forest, Grand Magic Games teams)
- **Drama**: Teamwork, covering weaknesses, combo techniques
- **AIDM**: NPC allies have strengths/weaknesses, player coordinates strategy

#### 4. **Promotion Exam**
- **Format**: Test to achieve next rank (Chunin, Pro Hero License)
- **Drama**: Not just combat—leadership, tactics, ethics tested
- **AIDM**: Multi-phase exam (written test, combat, rescue scenario)

**Tournament Arc Beats**:
```
Round 1: Player vs Fodder (easy win, show off basic skills)
Round 2: Player vs Rival (close match, new technique debut)
Round 3: Player vs Unexpected Threat (struggle, creativity required)
Finals: Player vs Arc Antagonist or Mentor Figure (ultimate test)

Alternative: Player loses in finals BUT impresses judges/earns respect
```

**AIDM Guidance**:
```markdown
Tournament arcs are NOT just combat sequences:
- Character development (rivals' backstories revealed)
- Tactical diversity (vary fight styles: speed, power, trickery, support)
- Emotional stakes (prove worth, earn recognition, save someone)
- Foreshadowing (see future villain's power, hint at larger plot)

Keep fights dynamic:
- Environmental destruction (shockwaves, craters, collapsing arena)
- Crowd reactions (awe, fear, excitement)
- Announcer commentary (hype moments)
- Strategic evolution (mid-fight adaptation)
```

---

### The Power of Friendship (仲間)

**Concept**: Bonds with allies provide literal or metaphorical strength

**Manifestations**:

#### 1. **Emotional Power-Up**
- **Trigger**: Friend in danger, memories of promises, bonds recalled
- **Effect**: Temporary stat boost, second wind, rage mode
- **Examples**: Natsu's "I'll protect my nakama!" fire boost, Luffy's gear shifts for crew
- **AIDM**: When ally is threatened, offer emotional power-up (temp +2 to all stats, special move unlocked)

#### 2. **Combo Techniques**
- **Mechanic**: Allies combine powers for stronger attack
- **Examples**: Jet Gatling (Luffy + support), Unison Raid (Fairy Tail)
- **AIDM**: If player and NPC ally both act, offer combo option (2x damage, costs both actions)

#### 3. **Trust & Covering Weaknesses**
- **Mechanic**: Allies defend player's vulnerabilities
- **Examples**: Tank protects mage, scout warns of ambush
- **AIDM**: NPCs act autonomously to support (no action cost for player)

#### 4. **Literal Shared Power**
- **Mechanic**: Allies lend energy/life force
- **Examples**: Goku's Spirit Bomb (everyone's energy), Naruto + Kurama synergy
- **AIDM**: Ritual/technique where allies sacrifice HP/MP to boost player's final attack

**Balance Friendship Power**:
```markdown
Friendship power-ups should:
- Require setup (bonds established in earlier sessions)
- Have emotional weight (not spammable)
- Cost something (HP drain, exhaustion, one-time use)
- Feel earned (player made sacrifices for allies earlier)

Avoid:
- "Friendship = auto-win" (still requires strategy)
- Unearned power (just met, suddenly combines powers)
```

---

### The Rival Dynamic (ライバル)

**Purpose**: Push protagonist to improve, provide narrative foil, mirror journey

**Rival Types**:

#### 1. **The Equal** (Vegeta, Sasuke, Bakugo)
- **Dynamic**: Started similar, constantly one-upping each other
- **Arc**: Rivalry → Grudging respect → Friendship → Partnership
- **AIDM**: Rival appears at key moments, slightly ahead in power, challenges player

#### 2. **The Superior** (Endeavor to Shoto, Mihawk to Zoro)
- **Dynamic**: Protagonist chases distant goal (surpass this person)
- **Arc**: Admiration → Training → Close gap → Eventually surpass (or earn respect)
- **AIDM**: Rival is Tier above player, represents ceiling to reach

#### 3. **The Dark Mirror** (Gaara to Naruto, Shigaraki to Deku)
- **Dynamic**: "What protagonist could have become" (different choices)
- **Arc**: Opposition → Understanding → Redemption or tragic clash
- **AIDM**: Rival has similar backstory, chose different path (revenge vs heroism)

**Rival Encounter Beats**:
```
First Meeting: Rival humiliates or impresses protagonist
Midpoint: Protagonist closes gap, earns rival's attention
Climax: Epic battle (can end in draw, narrow loss, or hard-won victory)
Resolution: Mutual respect, team-up against greater threat
```

**AIDM Rival Implementation**:
```markdown
Create recurring rival NPC:
- Name, distinct fighting style, clear motivation
- Appears every 5-10 sessions with visible power growth
- Tracks player's achievements, adjusts own training
- Eventually becomes ally (80% of cases) or final boss (20%)

Rival dialogue:
- "You've gotten stronger... but not strong enough."
- "I won't lose to you this time."
- "Tch. Not bad." (grudging admission)
- "Let's settle this once and for all!"
```

---

### The Mentor Sacrifice (師匠の死)

**Purpose**: Emotional catalyst, remove safety net, force protagonist to stand alone

**Mentor Death/Departure Patterns**:

#### 1. **Heroic Sacrifice**
- **Event**: Mentor dies protecting protagonist or buying time
- **Effect**: Guilt + determination ("I'll honor their legacy")
- **Examples**: Jiraiya (Naruto), Ace's death impact on Luffy

#### 2. **Defeated by Villain**
- **Event**: Villain proves strength by killing/crippling mentor
- **Effect**: Establishes threat level, motivates revenge/justice
- **Examples**: All Might's decline, Genkai's death (Yu Yu Hakusho)

#### 3. **Natural Departure**
- **Event**: Mentor leaves when protagonist ready ("You've surpassed me")
- **Effect**: Bittersweet growth, solo journey begins
- **Examples**: Gon leaving Whale Island, end of training arcs

**AIDM Guidance**:
```markdown
Mentor death should:
- Happen at narrative midpoint (not too early, not end)
- Unlock protagonist's hidden power (emotional trigger)
- Provide final lesson (last words, inherited technique)
- Drive next arc (hunt mentor's killer, complete mentor's dream)

Alternatives to death:
- Mentor captured (rescue arc)
- Mentor loses powers (role reversal, player protects them)
- Mentor's dark past revealed (trust crisis)
```

---

## Shonen Sub-Tropes

### Transformation Sequences (変身)

**Types**:

#### 1. **Super Modes** (Power-Up Forms)
- **Examples**: Super Saiyan (Dragon Ball), Gear 4th (One Piece), Bankai (Bleach)
- **Mechanics**: Stat multiplier (x2, x5, x10), limited duration, high stamina cost
- **Unlock Trigger**: Emotional breakthrough, intense training, ritual
- **AIDM**: Describe visual transformation (aura, physical changes), dramatic stat boost, timer starts

#### 2. **Elemental Cloaks** (属性)
- **Examples**: Naruto's chakra modes, Natsu's fire forms, Todoroki's dual-element
- **Mechanics**: Elemental damage boost, resistance to countering element, new techniques
- **AIDM**: Player channels element, attacks gain elemental properties

#### 3. **Possession/Fusion** (合体)
- **Examples**: Naruto + Kurama, Ichigo + Hollow, Yuji + Sukuna
- **Mechanics**: Ally/spirit lends power, personality changes, potential loss of control
- **AIDM**: Dialogue changes (spirit interjects), power boost with risk (roll to maintain control)

**Transformation Escalation**:
```
Base Form → Initial Awakening → Controlled Form → Mastered Form → Final Form → Beyond (breaking limits)

Dragon Ball example: Base → SSJ → SSJ2 → SSJ3 → SSJ God → SSJ Blue → Ultra Instinct
```

---

### Hidden Potential & Bloodlines (血継限界)

**Bloodline/Heritage Reveals**:
- **Late Discovery**: "You're actually descended from legendary X"
- **Examples**: Naruto (Uzumaki + Ashura reincarnation), Ichigo (Soul Reaper + Quincy + Hollow)
- **Effect**: Explains rapid growth, unlocks new abilities, adds destiny element

**Chosen One vs Earned Power**:
```markdown
Balance bloodline advantages:
- Bloodline provides POTENTIAL, not guaranteed strength
- Still requires training to unlock (Sasuke worked for Sharingan mastery)
- Others without bloodline can compete (Rock Lee, Asta's anti-magic)

Avoid: "I'm strong only because of genetics" (undermines effort theme)
```

---

### Underdog Heroes & Hard Work

**Hard Work vs Talent Debate**:
- **Pure Hard Work**: Rock Lee (no natural talent, only taijutsu mastery via training)
- **Talent + Work**: Sasuke (Uchiha genius, but still trains obsessively)
- **Natural Gift**: Kakashi (prodigy, but refined through experience)

**AIDM Guidance**:
```markdown
If player chooses "no special bloodline/power":
- Compensate with unique technique (self-created style)
- Faster skill growth (training yields better results)
- Strategic genius (beat stronger foes via tactics)
- Indomitable will (power-ups from sheer determination)

Show that hard work DOES pay off (core shonen message)
```

---

### Team Formations & Roles

**Classic Team Structure**:

1. **The Leader/Protagonist** (Naruto, Luffy, Deku)
   - Role: Morale, frontline fighter, inspires team
   - Weakness: Reckless, simple-minded

2. **The Rival/Deuteragonist** (Sasuke, Zoro, Bakugo)
   - Role: Raw power, pragmatic decisions
   - Weakness: Lone wolf tendencies, pride

3. **The Heart/Support** (Sakura, Nami, Uraraka)
   - Role: Healing, ranged support, emotional anchor
   - Weakness: Physically weaker (usually improves later)

4. **The Smart One** (Shikamaru, Usopp, Iida)
   - Role: Strategy, planning, information gathering
   - Weakness: Overthinks, less combat-oriented

5. **The Mentor/Senior** (Kakashi, Jiraiya, All Might)
   - Role: Guidance, training, safety net
   - Eventual Exit: See Mentor Sacrifice above

**AIDM Team Management**:
```markdown
Give each NPC ally:
- Clear role (tank, DPS, healer, support)
- Personality quirk (comic relief, serious, hot-headed)
- Personal arc (redemption, proving worth, overcoming trauma)
- Signature move (recognizable combat style)

Rotate spotlight:
- Some sessions focus on ally's backstory
- Tag-team battles where ally shines
- Ally gets power-up arc too (not just protagonist)
```

---

### The "I Won't Run Away!" Moment

**Concept**: Protagonist faces overwhelming threat, chooses to stand and fight despite fear

**Story Beat**:
```
1. Threat Introduced: Villain far beyond protagonist's level
2. Fear Response: Protagonist considers fleeing, allies urge retreat
3. Stakes Revealed: Someone precious will die if protagonist runs
4. Decision: "I won't run away!" (declaration of resolve)
5. Desperate Stand: Protagonist fights, likely loses but earns respect
6. Rescue/Survival: Ally arrives, or protagonist's courage awakens new power
```

**Examples**:
- Deku vs Muscular (save Kota)
- Naruto vs Pain (protect village)
- Luffy vs Kaido (first encounter, gets wrecked but shows guts)

**AIDM Guidance**:
```markdown
Present impossible fight:
- Enemy is Tier 2+ above player
- Retreat is valid option (NPC suggests it)
- BUT innocent/friend will die if player runs

If player chooses to fight:
- Narrate desperate struggle (landing few hits, taking massive damage)
- Offer emotional power-up (rage, determination, memory flashback)
- Outcome: Lose but survive (rescue arrives) OR unlock new ability (limit break)

**Reward**: Courage-based stat growth, NPC loyalty boost, reputation gain
```

---

### Exam & Mission Arcs

**Chunin Exam Structure** (Multi-Phase Test):

1. **Phase 1: Written Exam** (Intelligence test, cheating tactics)
2. **Phase 2: Survival** (Forest of Death, scroll hunt)
3. **Phase 3: Tournament** (Combat showcase)

**AIDM Exam Design**:
```markdown
Create multi-phase test:
- Academic (test knowledge, trick questions)
- Practical (combat, rescue, stealth)
- Ethical (save comrade vs complete mission)
- Final (exhibition match or trial)

Each phase eliminates some candidates, builds tension
```

---

## Shonen Combat Patterns

### Declaring Attacks (技名叫び)

**Concept**: Shouting attack names before/during execution

**Why It Works**:
- Adds dramatic flair (RASENGAN! KAMEHAMEHA!)
- Clarifies what's happening (visual medium)
- Hypes up ultimate moves

**AIDM Guidance**:
```markdown
Encourage players to name their techniques:
- "What do you call this move?"
- NPC attacks: Always name them dramatically
- Ultimate moves: Require full name shout for max damage

Example:
Player: "I attack with my fire punch."
AIDM: "Give it a name! As you channel flames into your fist, you roar—?"
Player: "CRIMSON METEOR STRIKE!"
AIDM: "Your fist blazes like a falling star! +2 damage for style."
```

---

### The "Get Back Up" Moment

**Concept**: Protagonist defeated, everyone thinks it's over, then... they stand up

**Execution**:
```
1. Protagonist knocked down, seemingly unconscious
2. Villain turns away ("Pathetic.")
3. Ally cries out or flashback triggers
4. Protagonist's hand twitches
5. Slow rise (bloodied, battered, but determined)
6. "I'm... not done yet..."
7. Second wind power-up (rage, friendship, willpower)
```

**AIDM Mechanics**:
```markdown
When player reduced to 0 HP:
- Offer "Second Wind" option (1/session)
- Cost: Permanent HP reduction (scar/injury)
- Effect: Restore 50% HP, +2 to all stats (desperation mode)
- Flavor: "Something deep inside refuses to quit. You WILL NOT fall here."

Make it EARNED (not spammable)
```

---

### Beam Clashes & Power Struggles

**Concept**: Two energy attacks collide, struggle for dominance

**Execution**:
```
Both fighters fire massive energy blasts
Beams collide in midair, creating shockwave
Camera shows both fighters straining, pouring more power
Flashbacks to why they fight (motivation fuel)
One side surges (ally help, emotional boost, limit break)
Winner's beam overwhelms, consumes loser
```

**AIDM Mechanics**:
```markdown
Contested Roll:
- Both roll d20 + relevant stat (INT for magic, STR for ki)
- Higher roll pushes beam forward
- Best of 3 rolls wins
- Allies can assist (add +1 per ally cheering/lending energy)

Describe each round:
- Roll 1: Beams equal, ground cracks beneath both
- Roll 2: Player surges, beam pushes forward (or vice versa)
- Roll 3: Final push, winner determined, massive explosion
```

## AIDM Implementation Guidelines

### Session Zero for Shonen Campaigns

**Questions to Ask**:
1. **Tone**: Pure action, or mix of action/comedy/drama?
2. **Power System**: Magic, ki, quirks, or other? (reference power_systems libraries)
3. **Team**: Solo hero or group dynamics?
4. **Rival**: Want a recurring rival character?
5. **Goal**: Become strongest, protect someone, defeat villain, achieve dream?
6. **Training Preference**: Quick montages or detailed training sessions?

### Creating Shonen NPCs

**Rival Template**:
```markdown
Name: [Similar age to player]
Motivation: [Become strongest / Revenge / Protect someone]
Fighting Style: [Contrasts player's style]
Signature Move: [Named technique]
Character Arc: [Pride → Respect → Friendship]
Recurring Line: ["I won't lose to you."]
```

**Mentor Template**:
```markdown
Name: [Older, experienced]
Motivation: [Atone for past / Pass on legacy]
Secret: [Hidden power or dark history]
Teaching Style: [Harsh taskmaster / Cryptic wisdom / Hands-off]
Death Flag: [Talks about retirement / Has terminal illness / Villain target]
Final Lesson: [Technique or philosophy passed on]
```

### Pacing Shonen Campaigns

**Session Rhythm**:
- **Action Sessions** (60%): Combat, training, challenges
- **Development Sessions** (30%): Character backstory, bonding, downtime
- **Plot Sessions** (10%): Lore reveals, villain schemes, foreshadowing

**Arc Length**:
- Short Arc: 3-5 sessions (mini-tournament, rescue mission)
- Medium Arc: 8-12 sessions (major villain, invasion)
- Long Arc: 15-25 sessions (war, world-ending threat)

**AIDM: Use this library when player wants classic battle shonen experience. Balance power fantasy with meaningful struggle. Remember: Shonen heroes win not because they're strongest, but because they refuse to give up.**

**Core Theme**: Determination, friendship, and hard work can overcome any obstacle. The journey matters more than the destination. Protect what's precious. Never betray your comrades.

**Most Important**: Make the player FEEL like a shonen protagonist—give them moments to declare their resolve, power up dramatically, protect their friends, and overcome impossible odds through sheer willpower. That's what makes shonen unforgettable.
