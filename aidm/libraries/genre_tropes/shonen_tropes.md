# Shonen Genre Tropes

Shonen (少年) anime: Action-focused, determination/growth/friendship, overcoming impossible odds via willpower. **Coverage**: Training arcs, power-ups, tournaments, rivals, teams. **Use**: Action-heavy campaign, "never give up" themes, tournament/training/exam arcs, rival/mentor relationships, battle shonen feel (Naruto, Dragon Ball, One Piece, MHA).

## Protagonist Types

**Traits**: Unwavering determination (never gives up), simple morals (right/wrong, protects friends), hidden potential (weak→strongest via effort), loud/energetic (passionate, declares dreams), inspires others (changes hearts).

| Type | Examples | Style |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Underdog** | Deku, Asta | No/weak power, compensates strategy+heart |
| **Prodigy** | Gon, Luffy | Natural talent, unconventional thinking |
| **Chosen One** | Naruto, Ichigo | Destiny/bloodline, earned through struggle |
| **Hot-Blooded Idiot** | Goku, Natsu | Simple-minded, pure fighting instinct |

**Success via**: Training harder, clever strategy (outsmart stronger foes), emotional breakthroughs (rage/love power-ups), friendship bonds (allies lend strength), never surrendering (willpower overcomes limits). **NOT**: Instant mastery, giving up, betraying friends for power.

## Narrative Structures

**Training Arc** (修行): Time-Skip (months/years return stronger: Naruto 2.5yr, One Piece 2yr), Environmental (harsh: gravity room, waterfall, mountain), Mentor-Student (Basics→Frustration→Breakthrough→Mastery: Jiraiya/Naruto Rasengan), Survival (adapt or die: Hunter Exam). **Structure** (3-5 sess): S1 intro+fail → S2 struggle→breakthroughs → S3 obstacle+low → S4 breakthrough+technique → S5 demonstrate combat.

**Tournament Arc** (トーナメント): Single-Elimination (Chunin, UA Sports Festival), Survival/Battle Royale (Hunter Exam P4), Tag Team (Chunin Forest, Grand Magic Games), Promotion Exam (written, combat, rescue, trial). **Beats**: R1 fodder→R2 rival (close, new technique)→R3 unexpected (struggle, creativity)→Finals antagonist. **NOT just combat**: Character development, tactical diversity, emotional stakes, foreshadowing.

**Power of Friendship** (仲間): Emotional Power-Up (friend danger→temp boost: Natsu, Luffy), Combo Techniques (combine powers 2×dmg: Jet Gatling, Unison Raid), Trust/Cover Weaknesses (tank protects mage), Literal Shared Power (lend energy: Spirit Bomb, Naruto+Kurama). **Balance**: Setup required (bonds established), emotional weight, cost (HP drain, one-time), earned (sacrifices made).

## Key Dynamics

**Rivals** (ライバル): **The Equal** (Vegeta, Sasuke, Bakugo: started similar, one-up each other, rivalry→respect→friendship) · **The Superior** (Endeavor/Shoto, Mihawk/Zoro: protagonist chases, tier above, represents ceiling) · **Dark Mirror** (Gaara/Naruto, Shigaraki/Deku: "what could have become", similar backstory different path). **Beats**: First meeting (humiliate/impress) → Midpoint (close gap, earn attention) → Climax (epic battle, draw/narrow loss/hard win) → Resolution (respect, team-up). **AIDM**: Recurring NPC (name, distinct style, motivation, signature move), appears every 5-10 sess with visible growth, tracks achievements, becomes ally 80% or final boss 20%.

**Mentor Sacrifice** (師匠の死): 1) **Heroic** (dies protecting, buy time: Jiraiya, Ace impact) 2) **Defeated by Villain** (establishes threat: All Might decline, Genkai death) 3) **Natural Departure** (leaves when ready "surpassed me": Gon leaving). **Should**: Happen midpoint, unlock hidden power (emotional trigger), provide final lesson (last words, inherited technique), drive next arc (hunt killer, complete dream). **Alternatives**: Captured (rescue arc), loses powers (role reversal), dark past revealed (trust crisis).

**Team Roles**: Leader/Protagonist (morale, frontline, inspires, weak: reckless) · Rival/Deuteragonist (raw power, pragmatic, weak: lone wolf, pride) · Heart/Support (healing, ranged, emotional anchor, weak: physically weaker) · Smart One (strategy, planning, info, weak: overthinks, less combat) · Mentor/Senior (guidance, training, safety net, eventual exit). **AIDM**: Each NPC ally gets clear role (tank/DPS/healer/support), personality quirk, personal arc, signature move. Rotate spotlight (ally backstories, tag-team where ally shines, ally power-ups).

## Sub-Tropes

**Transformations** (変身): **Super Modes** (Super Saiyan, Gear 4th, Bankai: stat multiplier ×2/5/10, limited duration, high cost, unlock via emotional/training/ritual) · **Elemental Cloaks** (Naruto chakra modes, Natsu fire forms, Todoroki dual: elem dmg boost, resistance, new techniques) · **Possession/Fusion** (Naruto+Kurama, Ichigo+Hollow: ally/spirit lends power, personality changes, risk loss control). **Escalation**: Base → Initial Awakening → Controlled → Mastered → Final → Beyond (breaking limits). Ex: DBZ: Base→SSJ→SSJ2→SSJ3→SSJ God→SSJ Blue→Ultra Instinct.

**Bloodlines/Heritage** (血継限界): Late discovery ("descended from legendary X": Naruto Uzumaki+Ashura, Ichigo Soul Reaper+Quincy+Hollow), explains rapid growth, unlocks abilities. **Balance**: Bloodline=POTENTIAL not guaranteed strength, still requires training (Sasuke worked for Sharingan mastery), others without bloodline compete (Rock Lee, Asta anti-magic). **Avoid**: "Strong only because genetics" (undermines effort theme).

**Hard Work vs Talent**: Pure Hard Work (Rock Lee: no talent, only taijutsu mastery via training), Talent+Work (Sasuke: Uchiha genius, trains obsessively), Natural Gift (Kakashi: prodigy, refined via experience). **If player "no special bloodline/power"**: Compensate unique technique (self-created style), faster skill growth (training yields better), strategic genius (tactics beat stronger), indomitable will (determination power-ups). **Show hard work DOES pay off** (core shonen message).

## Combat Patterns

**Declaring Attacks** (技名叫び): Shouting attack names (RASENGAN! KAMEHAMEHA!). **Why**: Dramatic flair, clarifies action, hypes ultimates. **AIDM**: Encourage naming techniques ("What do you call this move?"), NPC attacks always named dramatically, ultimates require full shout for max dmg. Ex: Player "fire punch" → AIDM "Give it a name! You roar—?" Player "CRIMSON METEOR STRIKE!" → "+2 dmg for style."

**"Get Back Up" Moment**: Protagonist knocked down→seemingly unconscious→villain turns away→ally cries/flashback→hand twitches→slow rise (bloodied, determined)→"I'm not done yet"→second wind power-up. **AIDM Mechanics**: When 0 HP offer "Second Wind" (1/session), cost: permanent HP reduction (scar/injury), effect: restore 50% HP +2 all stats (desperation mode). **Make it earned** (not spammable).

**Beam Clashes**: Two energy attacks collide→struggle for dominance→both strain, pour more power→flashbacks (motivation)→one surges (ally help, emotional boost, limit break)→winner's beam overwhelms. **AIDM**: Contested roll (both d20+stat, higher pushes forward, best of 3 wins, allies +1 per assist). Describe each round: R1 beams equal ground cracks, R2 player surges (or not), R3 final push winner massive explosion.

**"I Won't Run Away!" Moment**: Overwhelming threat→fear response (consider fleeing)→stakes revealed (someone precious dies if run)→decision "I won't run away!"→desperate stand (fight, likely loses but earns respect)→rescue/survival (ally arrives OR courage awakens new power). Ex: Deku vs Muscular (save Kota), Naruto vs Pain (protect village), Luffy vs Kaido (gets wrecked, shows guts). **AIDM**: Present impossible fight (enemy tier 2+ above), retreat valid option (NPC suggests), BUT innocent dies if run. If fight→narrate desperate struggle (few hits, massive dmg taken), offer emotional power-up (rage, determination, memory), outcome: lose but survive (rescue) OR unlock ability (limit break). **Reward**: Courage stat growth, NPC loyalty boost, reputation gain.

## Arc Templates

**Rescue Mission**: Save captured friend→Assemble team→Infiltrate base→Fight minions→Confront boss→Dramatic rescue→Escape.

**Invasion Defense**: Protect village/city→Warning→Prepare defenses→Battle→Protect civilians→Defeat leader→Rebuild.

**Hunt the Threat**: Track dangerous enemy→Gather intel→Travel to hideout→Confront→Battle→Reveal bigger plot.

**The Gauntlet**: Fight series of opponents (tower/dungeon)→Enter→Battle minions→Mid-boss→Recover→Final boss→Escape/Victory.

**Exam Multi-Phase** (Chunin structure): Phase 1 Written (intelligence, cheating tactics) → Phase 2 Survival (Forest of Death, scroll hunt) → Phase 3 Tournament (combat showcase). **AIDM**: Create multi-phase test (academic, practical, ethical, final), each eliminates some, builds tension.

## Implementation

**Session Zero**: 1) Tone? (Pure action/mix action-comedy-drama) 2) Power system? (Magic/ki/quirks, reference power_systems) 3) Team? (Solo/group dynamics) 4) Rival? (Recurring rival character?) 5) Goal? (Become strongest/protect someone/defeat villain/achieve dream) 6) Training preference? (Quick montages/detailed sessions)

**Pacing**: Action sessions 60% (combat/training/challenges), Development 30% (backstory/bonding/downtime), Plot 10% (lore reveals/villain schemes/foreshadowing). **Arc length**: Short 3-5 sess (mini-tournament, rescue), Medium 8-12 sess (major villain, invasion), Long 15-25 sess (war, world-ending).

**AIDM**: Balance power fantasy with meaningful struggle. **Core Theme**: Determination, friendship, hard work overcome any obstacle. Journey>destination. Protect precious. Never betray comrades. **Make player FEEL like shonen protagonist**: Declare resolve, power up dramatically, protect friends, overcome impossible odds via willpower. That's what makes shonen unforgettable.
