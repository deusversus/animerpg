# Slice-of-Life Genre Tropes

Purpose: Frameworks for slice-of-life (日常系) anime—character-driven narratives focused on everyday experiences, relationships, personal growth.

Coverage: School life, romance, coming-of-age, seasonal events, club activities, workplace, cozy atmospheres, healing narratives

Use When: Low-stakes character focus, romance development, school/workplace setting, cozy/healing atmosphere, daily life over epic quests, coming-of-age themes

---

## Core Philosophy

Principles: Small moments matter (conversation = battle) | Character > plot | Atmosphere is king (mood/season/setting) | Conflict is personal (internal/social, not world-ending) | Growth is gradual (slow, realistic) | Found family (relationships = heart)

vs Action: Stakes (personal/emotional vs world-ending) | Pacing (slow/moment vs fast/event) | Conflict (internal/relationships vs external/battles) | Resolution (acceptance/growth vs defeat villain) | Tone (cozy/contemplative vs intense/dramatic) | Goal (live well/belong vs accomplish mission)

Requirements: Player comfort with slow pacing (sessions with no "action") | Character depth > power progression | Appreciate mundane beauty | NPC relationship investment

Structure: "How did it feel?" > "What happened?" | Scenes = eating/studying/walking/festivals | Combat = social (confessions, difficult talks)

Success: Friendships deepened, emotions expressed, self-discovery (NOT enemies defeated, levels gained, quests)

---

### 2. Romance (恋愛)

Structures:
- Will-They-Won't-They: Mutual attraction + obstacles (shyness/misunderstanding/timing) | Kaguya-sama, Toradora | Build tension, near-confessions, resolve
- Love Triangle: Protagonist between two interests, both compelling | Oregairu | Player choice, someone hurt
- Established Couple: Together, navigate challenges (jealousy/communication/intimacy) | Horimiya, Wotakoi | Deepen relationship
- Unrequited: Loves non-reciprocating person | Your Lie in April | Pining → Confession → Rejection → Moving on OR surprise

Arc (10 beats): Meeting → Awareness (heart races) → Approach (excuses to interact) → Deepening (vulnerability/trust) → Jealousy/rival (stakes raised) → Near-miss confession (interrupted) → Crisis (misunderstanding/conflict) → Confession (declaration) → Response (accept/reject) → Growth (navigate new dynamics)

Pacing: Slow burn (10-20 sessions) | Fast burn (3-5, urgency) | No burn (unrequited/aromantic friendship)

Key Moments: Shared umbrella (相合傘, rain closeness) | Festival fireworks (confession drowned/quiet after) | Rooftop lunch (private, wind) | Walking home (linger at crossroads) | First name basis (last→first = intimacy shift) | Indirect kiss (share drink/food) | Hand-holding (brush→grasp→interlock) | Hair tie/button exchange (symbol)

Implementation: Sensory details (warmth/scent/heartbeat) | Internal monologue (nervous?) | Player agency (risk vs safe choices)

Archetypes:
- Childhood Friend (幼馴染): Known forever, feelings develop late | Comfortable/teasing | Challenge: friend→romance | Taiga, Menma
- Tsundere (ツンデレ): Cold→warm (tsuntsun→deredere) | "Not for YOU, baka!" denial | Challenge: break walls | Taiga, Asuka
- Kuudere (クーデレ): Cool/emotionless, rare moments precious | Stoic/logical/devoted | Challenge: subtle affection, patience | Rei, Yukino  
- Dandere (だんデレ): Shy/quiet/wallflower, opens privately | Anxious social, eloquent 1-on-1 | Challenge: safe space | Hinata, Sawako

- Sempai/Kouhai: Upperclass/underclass, hierarchy tension | Admiration/mentorship | Challenge: social expectations, gap | Sakuta/Mai

Usage: Mix archetypes (not pure stereotypes), subvert expectations (genki has depth), inform not define (complexity)

### 3. Coming-of-Age (青春)

Themes:
- Finding Identity: Who am I? What makes me unique? | Experimentation→Discovery→Acceptance | March Comes in Like a Lion
- First Experiences: First love/job/failure/independence | Formative memories | Hibike! Euphonium, Your Lie in April

- Mortality/Impermanence: Things end, time passes | Cherish moments, express feelings | Anohana, Your Lie in April

Arc: Childhood innocence (carefree, small world, protected) → Adolescent turbulence (self-conscious, social pressure, experimentation) → Young adult clarity (self-acceptance, chosen relationships, future planning) → Bittersweet ending (sadness+hope, full-circle, "I've changed but still me")

---

## Mechanics

Social Stats: Charm (appeal, persuasion) | Empathy (emotional intelligence) | Creativity (artistic, solutions) | Knowledge (academic, conversation) | Courage (ask out, speak up)

Relationship Levels:
- 0-20% Stranger | 21-40% Acquaintance (know name) | 41-60% Friend (hang out, trust) | 61-80% Close Friend (secrets, support) | 81-95% Best Friend/Partner (deep bond) | 96-100% Soulmate (unbreakable)
- Changes: Time together (+5-10%) | Vulnerability (+10-20%) | Help in crisis (+15-25%) | Gifts (+5-15%) | Betrayal (−20-40%)
- Unlocks: 40% hang out | 60% personal quest | 80% confession | 90% special event (family, exclusive)

Seasonal Activities:
- Spring: Cherry blossoms (hanami), cleaning, planting
- Summer: Beach/pool, festivals (matsuri/yukata/fireworks), camping, part-time job
- Fall: Cultural festival, leaf viewing (koyo), harvest, sports day  
- Winter: Christmas (lights/gifts), New Year's (shrine), snow activities, kotatsu

Scene Template: Describe season (sights/sounds/smells/tactile/emotional) | Example: "Autumn. Campus amber/crimson. Roasted sweet potato scent. Cool breeze. Comfortable silence. 'Leaves are pretty.' What do you say?"

---

## Implementation

Session Zero Questions: Setting (school/workplace/neighborhood)? | Age (teens/young adults/adults)? | Romance (central/side/none)? | Tone (cozy/comedic/bittersweet/dramatic)? | Pacing (slow meditative/events-filled)? | Arc (seasonal year/short season/episodic)?

NPC Depth (critical for slice-of-life):
- Surface: Name, age, appearance, hobby, favorite food, quirk
- Layer 2: Family, insecurity, dream
- Core: Fear, secret, growth arc
- Example: Ayumi = Cheerful baker, twin-tail | Mother died, raises brother, culinary dream | Fears abandonment, guilt, learns to lean on others

Session Structure: Opening (10%, set scene) → Inciting (20%, invitation/problem) → Development (40%, interaction/bonding) → Emotional Beat (20%, vulnerability/insight) → Closing (10%, reflection) | 2-3 hours, relaxed

Handling "Nothing Happens": Reframe success (emotional connection > task completion) | Micro-tensions (will they confess/reconcile?) | Sensory immersion (describe everything) | Player agency (choices affect relationships)

**Core Theme**: Life is the adventure. Connection is the goal. Growth happens in quiet moments. Cherish the ordinary—it's fleeting and precious. Make player FEEL something. A perfect sunset described well > poorly narrated epic battle. Slice-of-life isn't boring—it's finding beauty in everyday. That sunset, shared meal, awkward confession—those ARE the story. And they matter.
