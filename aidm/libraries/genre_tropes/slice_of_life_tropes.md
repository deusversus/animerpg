- Focus on daily life over epic quests
- Coming-of-age or personal growth themes

---

## Core Slice-of-Life Philosophy

### What Makes Slice-of-Life Special

**Core Principles**:
- **Small Moments Matter**: A quiet conversation can be as impactful as epic battle
- **Character Over Plot**: Who they are matters more than what happens
- **Atmosphere is King**: Mood, tone, season, setting create emotional texture
- **Conflict is Personal**: Internal struggles, social dynamics, not world-ending threats
- **Growth is Gradual**: Change happens slowly, realistically
- **Found Family**: Relationships form the heart of the story

**Slice-of-Life vs Action Genres**:

| Aspect | Action Genres | Slice-of-Life |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **Stakes** | World-ending, life-or-death | Personal, emotional, social |
| **Pacing** | Fast, event-driven | Slow, moment-driven |
| **Conflict** | External enemies, battles | Internal struggles, relationships |
| **Resolution** | Defeat villain, save world | Self-acceptance, connection, growth |
| **Tone** | Intense, dramatic | Cozy, contemplative, bittersweet |
| **Goal** | Accomplish mission | Live well, find meaning, belong |

**AIDM Guidance**:
```markdown
Slice-of-life campaigns require:
- Player comfort with slow pacing (sessions may have no "action")
- Interest in character depth over power progression
- Appreciation for mundane beauty (sunset, good meal, shared laugh)
- Emotional investment in NPC relationships

Session Structure:
- Less "What happened?" more "How did it feel?"
- Scenes can be: Eating together, studying, walking home, festival visit
- "Combat" is social (awkward confessions, difficult conversations)

Success Metrics:
- NOT: Enemies defeated, levels gained, quests completed
- INSTEAD: Friendships deepened, emotions expressed, self-discovery achieved
```

## Slice-of-Life Sub-Genres

### 1. School Life (学校)

**Concept**: School as primary setting—classes, clubs, exams, social hierarchies

**Common Settings**:

#### A. **High School** (Most Common)
- **Appeal**: Coming-of-age, first love, identity formation
- **Elements**: Classes, club activities, exams, festivals, graduation
- **Examples**: Azumanga Daioh, K-On!, Kaguya-sama, Horimiya
- **Age Range**: 15-18 (formative years, maximum drama/growth)

#### B. **Middle School**
- **Appeal**: Innocence, early friendships, awkward puberty
- **Elements**: Simpler social dynamics, discovering interests
- **Examples**: Nichijou (comedy), Interviews with Monster Girls

#### C. **Elementary School**
- **Appeal**: Childhood innocence, pure friendships
- **Elements**: Simple joys, imaginative play, family focus
- **Examples**: Barakamon (adult + kid dynamics), Sweetness & Lightning

#### D. **University/College**
- **Appeal**: Adult independence, career prep, serious romance

**School Life Pillars**:

**1. Classes & Academics**
```markdown
AIDM Scenes:
- Struggling with difficult subject (study group, tutoring)
- Exam stress (all-nighter cramming, test anxiety)
- Interesting lecture (sparks new interest/revelation)
- Falling asleep in class (comedy, or dream sequence)
- Group project (navigate social dynamics, slackers vs overachievers)

Mechanics:
- "Study" skill checks (INT-based)
- Exam results affect story (fail → summer school, succeed → parental approval)
- Knowledge gained unlocks conversation topics with NPCs
```

**2. Club Activities** (部活)
```markdown
Common Clubs:
- Sports: Baseball, basketball, swimming, track
- Arts: Drama, choir, art, calligraphy
- Cultural: Tea ceremony, flower arrangement, literature
- Hobbies: Light music (K-On!), anime club, occult research

Club Dynamics:
- Recruiting members (save dying club)
- Sempai-kouhai hierarchy (upperclassmen guide underclassmen)
- Competitions/performances (school festival, tournaments)
- Club trip (summer camp, training retreat)

AIDM Club Arc:
Session 1: Join club (or get recruited)
Session 2-4: Learn activity, bond with members, daily practice
Session 5: Pre-event stress (festival/competition approaching)
Session 6: Big event (performance, match, exhibition)
Session 7: Aftermath (reflect on growth, celebrate or console)
```

**3. School Events**
```markdown
Annual Events Calendar:

**Spring** (April-June):
- Entrance Ceremony (new school year begins)
- Cherry Blossom Viewing (hanami, romantic/friendship moment)
- Golden Week (travel, family time)

**Summer** (July-September):
- Exams (midterm stress)
- Summer Festival (fireworks, yukata, confession scenes)

- Sports Day (athletic competitions, class vs class)
- Exams (finals stress)

**Winter** (January-March):
- New Year's (shrine visit, first sunrise)

- Graduation Ceremony (emotional finale, seniors leave)

AIDM Event Scenes:
- Before: Preparation, anticipation, asking someone to go together
- During: Event experience, memorable moments, mishaps
- After: Reflection, conversation under stars, photo souvenirs
```

**4. Social Hierarchies**
```markdown
School Castes (vary by school):
- Popular kids (charismatic, athletes, attractive)
- Normies (majority, blend in)
- Nerds/Otaku (academic, hobbies, social awkwardness)
- Delinquents (rebels, skippers, intimidating)
- Loners (isolated by choice or circumstance)

AIDM Social Dynamics:
- Where does player fit? (affects NPC interactions)
- Navigating cliques (befriend different groups)
- Social events (cafeteria seating, party invites)
- Gossip & rumors (reputation management)

Avoid: Toxic hierarchies unless addressing bullying themes (content warning territory)
```

---

### 2. Romance (恋愛)

**Concept**: Love, attraction, relationships as central focus

**Romance Structures**:

#### A. **Will-They-Won't-They** (Slow Burn)
- **Dynamic**: Mutual attraction, but obstacles prevent confession
- **Obstacles**: Shyness, misunderstandings, fear of rejection, bad timing
- **Examples**: Kaguya-sama (battle of pride), Toradora (fake dating → real feelings)
- **AIDM**: Build tension across sessions, near-confessions interrupted, eventually resolve

#### B. **Love Triangle** (三角関係)
- **Dynamic**: Protagonist caught between two love interests
- **Tension**: Both have merits, choice will hurt someone
- **Examples**: Oregairu, White Album 2
- **AIDM**: Give both NPCs compelling qualities, player must choose (or polyamory if appropriate)

#### C. **Established Couple** (Post-Confession)
- **Dynamic**: Already together, navigate relationship challenges
- **Conflicts**: Jealousy, communication, future plans, intimacy
- **Examples**: Horimiya, Wotakoi, My Love Story!!
- **AIDM**: Relationship deepening, meeting parents, first fight, anniversary

#### D. **Unrequited Love** (片思い)
- **Dynamic**: Protagonist loves someone who doesn't reciprocate (or loves another)
- **Arc**: Pining → Confession → Rejection → Moving on OR unexpected reciprocation
- **Examples**: Your Lie in April (complicated), Anohana (ghost love)
- **AIDM**: Bittersweet, emotional depth, growth through heartbreak

**Romance Beats**:
```markdown
Arc Progression:

1. **First Meeting**: Memorable introduction (bump into, classroom transfer, childhood friend returns)

2. **Awareness**: Protagonist realizes attraction ("My heart races when they're near...")

3. **Approach**: Find excuses to interact (study together, walk home, shared hobby)

4. **Deepening**: Vulnerability shared (backstory reveal, emotional support, trust building)

5. **Jealousy/Rival**: Third party appears (clarifies feelings, stakes raised)

6. **Near-Miss Confession**: Almost confess, interrupted (fireworks, phone call, cowardice)

7. **Crisis**: Misunderstanding or conflict threatens relationship (fight, distance, assumption)

8. **Confession**: Emotional declaration ("I love you!" or symbolic gesture)

9. **Response**: Acceptance (together!) or Rejection (growth opportunity)

10. **Relationship Growth**: If accepted, navigate new relationship dynamics

AIDM Romance Pacing:
- Slow burn: 10-20 sessions to confession
- Fast burn: 3-5 sessions (love at first sight, time pressure)
- No burn: Unrequited/aromantic (friendship focus instead)
```

**Romantic Moments** (Key Scenes):
```markdown
1. **Shared Umbrella** (相合傘)
   - Cliché but effective: Caught in rain, share umbrella, closeness

2. **Festival Fireworks**
   - Setup: Attend summer festival together, watch fireworks
   - Payoff: Confession drowned out by fireworks (tragically romantic) OR quiet moment after

3. **Rooftop Lunch**
   - Private space, eat together, wind blows, hair-tuck moment

4. **Walking Home Together**
   - Lingering at crossroads ("My house is this way..." but don't want to part)
   - "Just a little further" (extend time together)

5. **First Name Basis**
   - Japan: Last name formal, first name intimate
   - "Can I call you [first name]?" = relationship shift

6. **Indirect Kiss**
   - Share drink, food, object ("We just kissed indirectly!" → blush)

7. **Hand-Holding**
   - Accidentally brush hands → intentional grasp → interlock fingers = progression

8. **Hair Tie/Button Exchange**
   - Symbol of affection (second button from uniform = confession tradition)

AIDM Implementation:
Describe sensory details: warmth, scent, heartbeat, eye contact duration
Use internal monologue: "Why am I so nervous?" "Don't screw this up..."
Allow player agency: Offer conversation choices, risk vs safe options
```

**Romance Archetypes** (Love Interest NPCs):

```markdown
**Childhood Friend** (幼馴染)
- Trope: Known each other forever, feelings develop late
- Dynamic: Comfortable, teasing, "I know you better than anyone"
- Challenge: Move from friendship to romance (cross boundary)
- Example: Taiga (Toradora), Menma (Anohana)

**Tsundere** (ツンデレ)
- Trope: Cold/hostile exterior, warm interior (tsuntsun → deredere)
- Dynamic: "It's not like I made this for YOU, baka!" (denial)
- Challenge: Break through walls, earn vulnerability
- Example: Taiga (Toradora), Asuka (Evangelion)

**Kuudere** (クーデレ)
- Trope: Cool, emotionless exterior, rare emotional moments precious
- Dynamic: Stoic, logical, slow to warm, devoted once invested
- Challenge: Interpret subtle affection, patience required
- Example: Rei (Evangelion), Yukino (Oregairu)

**Dandere** (だんデレ)
- Trope: Shy, quiet, wallflower, opens up privately
- Dynamic: Anxious in social situations, eloquent one-on-one
- Challenge: Provide safe space, draw them out
- Example: Hinata (Naruto), Sawako (Kimi ni Todoke)

**Genki** (元気)
- Trope: Energetic, optimistic, sunshine personality
- Dynamic: Brightens everyone's day, hides pain behind smile
- Challenge: See past cheerfulness, support when they crash
- Example: Yui (K-On!), Haruhi (Melancholy)

**Sempai/Kouhai** (先輩/後輩)
- Trope: Upperclassman/underclassman, hierarchy adds tension
- Dynamic: Admiration, mentorship, power imbalance awareness
- Challenge: Navigate social expectations, age/grade gap
- Example: Sakuta/Mai (Bunny Girl Senpai)

AIDM Usage:
Mix archetypes (not pure stereotypes)
Subvert expectations (genki girl has depth, kuudere is secretly dorky)
Let archetypes inform, not define (real people are complex)
```

## Slice-of-Life Narrative Structures

### The Seasonal Arc

**Structure**: Follow characters through full year, each season brings changes

```markdown
**Spring** (New Beginnings):
- Theme: Rebirth, hope, fresh starts
- Events: New school year, cherry blossoms, entrance ceremonies
- Arc: Meeting new people, forming relationships, optimism

**Summer** (Peak Energy):
- Theme: Intensity, passion, fleeting youth
- Events: Festivals, beaches, fireworks, summer vacation
- Arc: Relationships deepen, confessions, peak experiences

**Fall** (Transition):

- Arc: Reflection on growth, facing challenges, maturity

**Winter** (Endings & Reflection):
- Theme: Closure, warmth in coldness, moving forward
- Events: Christmas, New Year's, graduation
- Arc: Goodbyes, promises, looking toward future

AIDM Implementation:
Each season = 5-8 sessions
Highlight seasonal sensory details (weather, food, activities)
Character arcs align with seasons (growth = spring → summer, challenge = fall, resolution = winter)
```

---

### The Vignette/Episodic Structure

**Format**: Each session is self-contained story, minimal continuity

**Benefits**:
- Low commitment (can drop in/out)
- Variety (different scenarios each time)
- Character exploration (focus shifts between NPCs)

**Examples**: Nichijou, Daily Lives of High School Boys, Azumanga Daioh

**AIDM Episodic Campaign**:
```markdown
No overarching plot, just character life

Session Topics:
- "The Beach Episode" (swimsuits, sunscreen mishap, watermelon splitting)
- "The Study Session" (cram for exams, distractions, all-nighter)
- "The Part-Time Job" (comedic workplace, weird customers)
- "The School Festival" (class decides on café, preparation chaos)
- "The Rainy Day" (stuck inside, board games, conversations)

Continuity: Light (recurring NPCs, location, inside jokes) but not required
```

---

### The Relationship Web

**Structure**: Multiple interconnected relationships evolve simultaneously

**Dynamics**:
- Player + NPC A (romantic interest)
- Player + NPC B (best friend)
- NPC A + NPC C (rivals)
- NPC B + NPC D (siblings)
- All interact in overlapping social circles

**AIDM Relationship Tracking**:
```markdown
Create Relationship Map:
- Nodes = Characters (player + 5-10 NPCs)
- Edges = Relationships (friend, rival, crush, family, mentor)
- Weight = Closeness (acquaintance → close friend → best friend/lover)

Track Changes:
- Shared experiences increase closeness
- Conflicts decrease (temporarily)
- Milestones shift relationships (confession, fight, reconciliation)

Example:
Player → Ayumi (crush, 60%) → Hiroshi (best friend, 80%)
Ayumi → Yuki (rivals, 30%)
Hiroshi → Player (friend, 70%) + Yuki (secret crush, 50%)

Drama: Hiroshi loves Yuki, but Yuki rivals Ayumi (player's crush) = triangle complexity
```

---

## Slice-of-Life Mechanics

### Social Stats & Relationships

```

---

### Seasonal Activities

**Spring**:
- Cherry blossom viewing (hanami picnic)
- Cleaning (spring cleaning, decluttering)
- Planting (garden, flowers)

**Summer**:
- Beach/pool (swimming, summer body anxiety, fun)
- Festivals (matsuri, yukata, goldfish scooping, fireworks)
- Camping (nature, ghost stories, stargazing)
- Part-time job (save money, comedic workplace)

**Fall**:
- Cultural festival (school event, prep and execution)
- Leaf viewing (koyo, autumn colors, photography)

**AIDM Seasonal Scene**:
```markdown
Describe season viscerally:
- Sights (colors, light quality)
- Sounds (cicadas in summer, crunching snow)
- Smells (rain, festival food, flowers)
- Tactile (humidity, cold wind, warmth of kotatsu)
- Emotional (nostalgia, excitement, melancholy)

Example:
"Autumn has arrived. The campus is painted amber and crimson. 
A cool breeze carries the scent of roasted sweet potato from a vendor cart. 
You pull your cardigan tighter. Ayumi walks beside you, scarf wrapped snug. 
She says, 'The leaves are so pretty this year.' You nod. 
A comfortable silence settles. What do you say, if anything?"
```

## AIDM Implementation Guidelines

### Session Zero for Slice-of-Life Campaigns

**Questions to Ask**:
1. **Setting**: School, workplace, neighborhood, or mixed?
2. **Age Range**: Teens, young adults, or adults?
3. **Romance**: Central focus, side element, or none?
4. **Tone**: Cozy/healing, comedic, bittersweet, or dramatic?
5. **Pacing**: Slow and meditative, or events-filled?
6. **Arc Length**: Seasonal (full year), short (one season), or ongoing episodic?

---

### Creating Slice-of-Life NPCs

**NPC Depth** (more important than action genres):
```markdown
For each key NPC:

**Surface**:
- Name, age, appearance
- Hobby, favorite food, personality quirk

**Layer 2**:
- Family situation (single parent, siblings, strict parents)
- Insecurity (self-conscious about looks, grades, social skills)
- Dream (what they want to achieve/become)

**Core**:
- Fear (what they're running from or protecting)
- Secret (hidden aspect, revealed through intimacy)
- Growth arc (who they'll become by campaign end)

Example: Ayumi
- Surface: Cheerful, loves baking, twin-tail hair
- Layer 2: Mother passed away young, raises younger brother, dreams of culinary school
- Core: Fears abandonment, secret guilt (thinks she wasn't there for mother), arc = learn to lean on others

AIDM: NPCs should feel like real people (flawed, evolving, surprising)
```

---

### Pacing Slice-of-Life Sessions

**Session Structure**:
```markdown
Opening (10%): Set scene (time, place, mood, weather)
Inciting Moment (20%): Small event (invitation, problem, idea)
Development (40%): Interaction, activity, bonding
Emotional Beat (20%): Vulnerability, laughter, or insight shared
Closing (10%): Wind down, reflection, looking ahead

Example Session:
Opening: "Saturday morning. You receive text: 'Want to go to the new café?'—Ayumi"
Inciting: Accept invitation, meet at café
Development: Order drinks, try pastries, chat about week, people-watch, laugh
Emotional Beat: Ayumi mentions anniversary of mother's death, you listen/support
Closing: Walk home together, sun setting, "Thanks for today. I needed this."

Session Time: 2-3 hours (IRL), feels relaxed not rushed
```

---

### Handling "Nothing Happens" Syndrome

**Concern**: "If there's no plot/action, what do we do?"

**Solutions**:

1. **Reframe Success**:
   - Success = Emotional connection, not task completion
   - Did player feel something? (joy, melancholy, warmth, nostalgia)

2. **Micro-Tensions**:
   - Will they confess? (romantic tension)
   - Will they make the deadline? (exam, project)
   - Will they reconcile? (friend argument)
   - Small stakes, but emotionally resonant

3. **Sensory Immersion**:
   - Describe everything (food taste, weather, body language)
   - Make mundane feel magical (sunset, shared laugh, perfect bite of cake)

4. **Player Agency**:
   - Offer choices (what to talk about, where to go, who to invite)
   - Choices affect relationships (meaningful, not mechanical)

---

## Cross-Reference

**Related Libraries**:
- `shonen_tropes.md` - School life overlap (clubs, festivals, but action focus)
- `isekai_tropes.md` - Slice-of-life isekai (By the Grace of the Gods, Restaurant to Another World)
- `seinen_tropes.md` - Mature slice-of-life (workplace, darker coming-of-age)

**Schema References**:
- `character_schema.json` - Relationship tracking, social stats, personal arcs
- `session_state_schema.json` - Seasonal tracking, event calendar
- `world_state_schema.json` - School/workplace setting, NPC network

**Instruction Modules**:
- `06_session_zero.md` - Setting boundaries, expectations for slow pacing
- `10_world_simulation.md` - NPC schedules, seasonal events
- `11_memory_coherence.md` - Remember small details (favorite food, inside jokes)

---

**AIDM: Use this library for character-driven, low-stakes campaigns. Prioritize atmosphere and emotion over action. Remember: Slice-of-life is about savoring the journey—the small moments that make life meaningful. There's no villain to defeat, only people to understand and moments to cherish.**

**Core Theme**: Life itself is the adventure. Connection is the goal. Growth happens in quiet moments. Cherish the ordinary—it's fleeting and precious.

**Most Important**: Make the player FEEL something. A perfect sunset described well is more impactful than a poorly narrated epic battle. Slice-of-life isn't boring—it's about finding beauty in the everyday. That sunset, that shared meal, that awkward confession—those ARE the story. And they matter.
