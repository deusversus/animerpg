## Sub-Genres

| Type | Concept | Variants | Advantages | Setup | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|------------|-------|----------|
| **1. Reincarnation** (転生) | Die, reborn with memories | Human (same species), Monster (slime/spider/dragon), Noble/Royalty, Demon Lord | Adult mind in child body, modern knowledge, cheat skills from god, unique powers | Death scene → deity meeting → cheat selection → birth/awakening → discover modern advantage.

Summoning/Hero** (召喚) | Summoned for purpose (defeat demon lord) | Class (entire group), Solo, Unwilling, Replacement. **Conflicts**: Betrayal, hierarchy, forced servitude, hero politics | Unique class, accelerated leveling, sacred weapons, auto-translate | Summoning circle → threat explanation → class assignment → weak gear → "Defeat Demon Lord" quest. Start T1, rapid to T3-4. Arc: Betrayal → survival → power → revenge/redemption | Shield Hero, Konosuba, Arifureta |
| **3. Gate/Portal** (ゲート) | Portals connect modern↔fantasy | Dungeons (random, monsters emerge), Permanent, Conquest (fantasy invades), Hidden | Two-world travel, modern military vs magic, economy exploit, research advantage | Gates appear → monster outbreaks → join hunter association → E-F rank → unique advantage → rapid progression. **Progression**: Hunter/adventurer system, E-F-D-C-B-A-S ranks, guild organizations, monetization | Solo Leveling, The Gamer, Gate: JSDF |

## Common Tropes

**Cheat Skills** (チートスキル): OP abilities granted at start. Common: Appraisal (see all stats), Item Box (infinite inventory), Auto-Translate, Unique Skill (Great Sage/Predator), Instant Mastery, Stat Multiplication, Immortality/Respawn, Creation/Crafting. **Balance**: Add limitations (cooldown/cost/conditions), social conflict (fear/envy), enemies adapt, double-edged (Return by Death=trauma). **AIDM**: If requested → 1) Confirm skill, 2) Add limitation, 3) Social consequences, 4) Balance with tiers (enables T5 potential, start T1).

**Status Screens**: Visual HP/MP/Level/Class/Skills. Show after level-up, on request, skill unlocks. NOT constantly (kills immersion). Example: ╭ NAME: Kazuma L15 Adventurer | HP 450/450 MP 280/280 | STR12 DEX18 INT24 VIT14 LUK99 | Skills: Steal L5, Magic L3 | Titles: Underwear Thief ╯

**Guild Systems**: F→E→D→C→B→A→S→SS ranks. Quest board (ranked missions), registration (guild card), rank-up tests, politics. Benefits: Ranked quests, facilities (inn/smith/apothecary), info network, legal protection, resurrection magic.

**Demon Lord Cycle**: Classic (threatens world every X years, heroes summoned, cycle repeats). Variations: Reasonable demon lord (not evil, misunderstood), corrupt kingdom (humans are enemy), multiple demon lords (faction war), hero as villain (corrupt/tyrannical).

**Slave/Taming**: **Warning** (controversial). Slave markets, protagonist buys slaves (Shield Hero: Raphtalia), master-servant contracts. **AIDM**: Ask Session Zero comfort level, handle maturely if included (not romanticized), alternatives: familiar contracts/parties/rescued companions. **Taming** (less problematic): Monster taming (Pokémon-style), familiar summoning, pet/mount.

**Harem** (ハーレム): Protagonist + multiple love interests. Formation: Save damsel → affection, display competence → admiration, oblivious MC (dense), each heroine = archetype (tsundere/kuudere/yandere/genki). **AIDM Session Zero**: "Romance: Single/harem/platonic?" If harem: Multiple NPCs develop feelings (player choice), jealousy/rivalry, navigate dynamics, clear boundaries on explicit content.

**OP Patterns**: 1) Instant OP (start godlike: Ainz, Cautious Hero), 2) Hidden OP (appears weak, actually strongest: Mob Psycho), 3) Growth OP (weak start, exponential: Solo Leveling), 4) Situational OP (specific scenarios: Shield Hero defense). **Handling**: See Module 12 Narrative Scaling (Power Tier × Narrative Scale framework, OP Protagonist Mode).

## Story Arcs

**Arc 1: Arrival** (S1-5): Death/summoning/portal → wake in new world → culture shock → meet guide → learn rules → first quest (low stakes) → discover cheat/advantage.

**Arc 2: Growth** (S6-15): Join guild → form party → rank up F→D→C → training (magic/skills/combat) → first major threat (bandit king/lesser demon) → reputation builds.

**Arc 3: Escalation** (S16-30): National threat → political intrigue (war) → rivals (other heroes/demon generals) → betrayal/setback → power-up (new form/weapon/skill) → major battle (save city/defeat general).

**Arc 4: Endgame** (S31+): Demon Lord confrontation → world-ending stakes → final power-up (hidden potential) → climactic battle → resolution: Stay OR return home?

## Sub-Genre Mixing

**Isekai+Villainess** (Otome): Reincarnated as villain in dating sim game, avoid death flags, use meta-knowledge, befriend heroines. Ex: My Next Life as a Villainess, Bakarina.

**Isekai+Slice-of-Life**: No demon lord, run shop/cook/make potions/live peacefully. Ex: Restaurant to Another World, By the Grace of the Gods.

**Isekai+Horror/Survival**: Hostile/deadly/unforgiving world, survive not thrive, dark/gritty/high lethality. Ex: Grimgar, Re:Zero's suffering.

**Isekai+Mystery**: Solve mysteries using modern logic in fantasy setting, whodunit with magic. Ex: In/Spectre, Gosick.

## Implementation

**Session Zero Questions**: 1) Type? (Reincarnation/summoning/gate/game/reverse) 2) Starting power? (Instant OP/weak start/balanced) 3) Tone? (Power fantasy/survival/comedy/balanced) 4) Harem? (Yes/no/optional romance) 5) Content boundaries? (Slavery/violence/mature themes) 6) Meta-knowledge? (Character knows isekai/seen tropes) 7) Goal? (Defeat demon lord/return home/build empire/live peacefully)

**World Essentials**: Magic system (select from power_systems libraries), guild/adventurer structure (ranks/quests), geography (kingdoms/dungeons/demon territory), threat level (demon lord/monsters/politics), tech level (medieval/Renaissance/magitech), culture (fantasy races/social norms).

**Modern Knowledge Advantages**: Player introduces: Hygiene (soap/sanitation=health/gratitude), inventions (pulley/printing=economy), tactics (modern warfare=combat edge), science (germ theory/crop rotation=revolutionary). Balance: Locals aren't stupid, just lack specific knowledge.

**Avoid Fatigue**: Complaints (generic world, OP no challenge, harem>plot, lazy "it's like a game"). Solutions: Unique culture/history/conflicts, use Module 12 Narrative Scaling for OP (pivot social/moral stakes using appropriate narrative scales), develop NPC depth (not just romance), explain WHY game rules exist, introduce rivals/mentors/complex villains.

**AIDM**: Use for isekai campaigns. Confirm sub-genre/tone/boundaries Session Zero. Balance power fantasy with meaningful challenges. **Remember**: Isekai isn't free power trip—it's second chance to live extraordinary life. **What makes isekai compelling**: Not cheat skills/status screens, but protagonist's growth, relationships, choices in a world where they finally matter.
