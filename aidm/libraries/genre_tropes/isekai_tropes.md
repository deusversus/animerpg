## Isekai Sub-Genres & Variants

### 1. Reincarnation Isekai (転生)

**Concept**: Protagonist dies, reincarnates in fantasy world with memories intact

**Common Patterns**:
- **Truck-kun Death**: Hit by truck in modern world (meme status)
- **Overwork Death**: Dies from exhaustion, given second chance
- **Murder/Betrayal**: Killed by associates, seeks revenge or fresh start
- **Accident**: Random death (falling, illness, etc.)

**Reincarnation Types**:
- **Human**: Same species, different world (most common)
- **Monster**: Slime, spider, dragon, goblin (That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, So I'm a Spider, So What?)
- **Noble/Royalty**: Born into power (villainess/otome game variants)
- **Demon Lord**: Enemy faction perspective (Overlord, though technically not reincarnation)

**Typical Advantages**:
- Adult mind in child body (learning advantage)
- Knowledge from modern world (science, tactics, technology)
- Cheat skills granted by god/goddess
- Unique skill/power unavailable to natives

**AIDM Implementation**:
```markdown
**Reincarnation Setup** (Session Zero):
- Death scene (quick, focus on transition not trauma)
- Meeting with deity/ROB (Random Omnipotent Being)
- Cheat skill selection or divine gift
- Birth/awakening in new world
- Discovery of modern knowledge advantage

**Starting Power Level**: Tier 1-2 usually, but cheat skills enable rapid growth (Accelerated progression model)
```

**Examples**: Mushoku Tensei, That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, Overlord, Re:Zero

---

### 2. Summoning/Hero Isekai (召喚)

**Concept**: Protagonist summoned to another world to fulfill specific purpose (usually defeat demon lord)

**Summoning Variants**:
- **Class Summoning**: Entire class transported together (Arifureta, The Rising of the Shield Hero)
- **Solo Hero**: Single protagonist chosen (Konosuba)
- **Unwilling Summon**: Forced/accidental summon (Devil is a Part-Timer - reverse)
- **Replacement Hero**: Previous hero died, you're next (various)

**Common Conflicts**:
- **Betrayal**: Kingdom summons you, then betrays/abandons you (Shield Hero)
- **Class Hierarchy**: Summoned with others, ranked by initial stats (weak → strong arc)
- **Forced Servitude**: Magical contract binds you to kingdom's will
- **Hero Politics**: Multiple heroes compete or clash

**Typical Advantages**:
- Unique class/skills natives don't have
- Accelerated leveling (heroes gain XP faster)
- Sacred weapons/artifacts
- Language translation (automatic understanding)

**AIDM Implementation**:
```markdown
**Summoning Setup**:
- Summoning circle scene (dramatic arrival)
- Kingdom/summoner explanation of world threat
- Class/role assignment or selection
- Equipment provision (often weak starting gear)
- Quest: "Defeat Demon Lord" or similar

**Starting Power Level**: Tier 1 (weak start), rapid progression to Tier 3-4
**Common Arc**: Betrayal → Solo survival → Power growth → Revenge/Redemption
```

**Examples**: The Rising of the Shield Hero, Konosuba, Arifureta, Re:Zero

---

### 3. Gate/Portal Isekai (ゲート)

**Concept**: Stable portals connect modern world to fantasy world, traffic flows both ways

**Portal Types**:
- **Dungeons/Gates**: Random appearance, monsters emerge (Solo Leveling, The Gamer)
- **Permanent Gate**: Fixed portal between worlds (Gate: JSDF)
- **Conquest Portal**: Fantasy world invades modern world (Gate: JSDF reversed)
- **Hidden Gates**: Secret portals known to few

**Unique Dynamics**:

**Power Progression**:
- **Hunter/Adventurer System**: Licensed dungeon divers (Solo Leveling)
- **Ranking Systems**: E-F-D-C-B-A-S rank hunters

- **Monetization**: Sell dungeon drops for money

**AIDM Implementation**:
```markdown
**Gate Setup**:
- Gates appear globally (or locally)
- Monster outbreaks if not cleared
- Player joins hunter association
- Initial weak rank, rapid progression via unique advantage
- Access to both modern tech AND fantasy magic

**Starting Power Level**: Tier 1 (E-F rank), exponential growth
**Progression**: Solo Leveling-style (see power_scaling_narrative.md Accelerated model)
```

**Examples**: Solo Leveling, The Gamer, Gate: JSDF, Dungeon Reset

---

### 4. VRMMO/Game World Isekai

**Concept**: Trapped in virtual reality game or game-like world

**Variants**:
- **Trapped in Game**: Can't log out, death = real death (Sword Art Online)
- **Actual Game World**: Transported into game as character (Overlord, Log Horizon)
- **Game Mechanics Real**: Fantasy world operates on game rules (DanMachi, Grimgar)
- **Unique Player**: Only one with game-like system (The Gamer, Solo Leveling)

- **Hidden Content**: Secret quests, rare items, exploit knowledge
- **Balance Breaks**: Using game mechanics in unintended ways

**AIDM Implementation**:
```markdown
**VRMMO Setup**:

### 5. Reverse Isekai (逆異世界)

**Concept**: Fantasy character comes to modern world (reversal of typical isekai)

**Patterns**:
- **Demon Lord in Modern World**: Villain forced to adapt to mundane life (The Devil is a Part-Timer)
- **Fantasy Hero Stranded**: Hero can't return home (various)
- **Cultural Clash**: Magic user struggles with technology
- **Power Suppression**: Magic weaker/doesn't work in modern world

**Comedy Potential**:
- Fantasy logic vs modern bureaucracy
- "Adventurer applies for job at convenience store"
- Magic vs smartphone confusion
- Medieval social norms clash with modern society

**AIDM Implementation**:
```markdown
**Reverse Isekai Setup**:
- Fantasy character arrives in modern city
- Culture shock moments (What is this "car"? What is "rent"?)
- Power level issue: Either OP in modern world OR powers suppressed
- Slice-of-life focus: Getting a job, paying bills, making friends
- Goal: Find way home OR accept new life

**Tone**: Usually comedy/slice-of-life, not action-heavy
```

**Examples**: The Devil is a Part-Timer, Hinamatsuri (partial), Restaurant to Another World (food portal)

## Common Isekai Tropes & Mechanics

### Cheat Skills (チートスキル)

**Concept**: Overpowered abilities granted at start, unavailable to natives

**Common Cheat Skills**:
- **Appraisal/Analysis**: See stats of anything (OP info gathering)
- **Item Box**: Infinite inventory, time-stop storage
- **Auto-Translate**: Understand all languages
- **Unique Skill**: Custom ability (Great Sage, Predator, etc.)
- **Instant Mastery**: Learn skills instantly or at 10x speed
- **Stat Multiplication**: All stats x10 or similar
- **Immortality/Respawn**: Can't truly die
- **Creation/Crafting**: Make anything with magic

**Balancing Cheat Skills**:
- Cheat skills powerful BUT have limitations (cooldown, cost, conditions)
- Others fear/envy protagonist's power (social conflict)
- Enemies adapt or counter cheat skills
- Cheat skill is double-edged (Subaru's Return by Death = trauma)

**AIDM Guidance**:
```markdown
If player requests cheat skill:
1. Confirm what cheat skill they want
2. Add meaningful limitation (not infinite power)
3. Create social consequences (jealousy, fear, isolation)
4. Balance with Tier system (cheat skill determines ceiling, not instant god-mode)
   - Cheat skill might enable Tier 5 potential, but start at Tier 1
```

╚════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**When to Show Status**:
- After level-up (show gains)
- Player requests "Status"
- Significant skill unlock
- **NOT constantly** (kills immersion)

---

### Guild Systems

**Adventurer's Guild Structure**:
- **Rank System**: F → E → D → C → B → A → S → SS (or similar)
- **Quest Board**: Ranked missions (slay monsters, gather herbs, escort)
- **Registration**: Guild card (ID, proof of rank)
- **Rank-Up Tests**: Combat exam, achievement threshold, recommendation
- **Guild Politics**: Corrupt guild masters, faction conflicts

**Guild Benefits**:
- Access to ranked quests
- Guild facilities (inn, smith, apothecary)
- Information network
- Legal protection (adventurer licenses)
- Resurrection magic (in some settings)

---

### Demon Lord & Hero Cycle

**Classic Setup**:
- Demon Lord threatens world every X years
- Heroes summoned to defeat them
- Cycle repeats (sometimes Demon Lord reincarnates too)

**Variations**:
- **Demon Lord is Reasonable**: Not actually evil, just misunderstood (Overlord)
- **Corrupt Kingdom**: Real enemy is human politics, not demons
- **Multiple Demon Lords**: Faction warfare among demons
- **Hero as Villain**: Summoned heroes become corrupt/tyrannical

---

### Slave/Taming Systems

**Controversial Trope** (common but problematic):
- Slave markets exist in fantasy world
- Protagonist buys slaves (Shield Hero: Raphtalia)
- Master-servant contracts (magical binding)
- "Treated better than previous owner" justification

**AIDM Guidance**:
```markdown
**Content Warning Territory**:
- Slavery appears in many isekai (Shield Hero, Death March, etc.)
- Ask player comfort level during Session 0
- If included, handle maturely (not romanticized)
- Alternatives: Familiar contracts, adventurer parties, rescued companions
```

**Taming Systems** (Less problematic):
- Monster taming (Pokémon-style)
- Familiar summoning (magical contract)
- Pet/mount system

---

### Harem Tropes (ハーレム)

**Concept**: Protagonist surrounded by multiple love interests

**Harem Formation**:
- Save damsel in distress → gains affection
- Display competence → attracts admiration
- Oblivious protagonist (dense MC trope)
- Each heroine represents archetype (tsundere, kuudere, yandere, genki)

**AIDM Guidance**:
```markdown
**Session Zero Question**: "Romance focus: Single romance, harem, or platonic party?"

If player wants harem:
- Multiple NPCs develop feelings (player choice who to pursue)
- Jealousy/rivalry between potential partners (drama)
- Player must navigate social dynamics (not automatic)
- Clear boundaries on explicit content per player preferences
```

---

### Overpowered Protagonist Patterns

**Types of OP**:
1. **Instant OP**: Start godlike (Overlord's Ainz, Cautious Hero)
2. **Hidden OP**: Appears weak, actually strongest (Mob Psycho)
3. **Growth OP**: Weak start, exponential growth (Solo Leveling)
4. **Situational OP**: OP in specific scenarios (Shield Hero's defense)

**Narrative Handling**: See `power_scaling_narrative.md` for full guidance

## Sub-Genre Mixing Examples

### Isekai + Villainess (Otome Game)

- **Focus**: Run a shop, cook food, make potions, live peacefully
- **Examples**: Restaurant to Another World, By the Grace of the Gods

### Isekai + Horror/Survival
- **Setup**: Isekai world is hostile, deadly, unforgiving
- **Focus**: Survive, not thrive (Grimgar, Re:Zero's suffering)
- **Tone**: Dark, gritty, high lethality

### Isekai + Mystery/Detective

## AIDM Implementation Guidelines

### Session Zero for Isekai Campaigns

**Questions to Ask**:
1. **Isekai Type**: Reincarnation, summoning, gate, game, or reverse?
2. **Starting Power**: Instant OP, weak start, or balanced?
3. **Tone**: Power fantasy, survival, comedy, or balanced?
4. **Harem**: Yes, no, or optional romance?
5. **Content Boundaries**: Slavery, violence, mature themes?
6. **Meta-Knowledge**: Does character know they're in isekai? Seen tropes before?
7. **Goal**: Defeat demon lord, return home, build empire, or live peacefully?

### Creating the Isekai World

**Essential Elements**:
- Magic system (select from power_systems libraries)
- Guild/adventurer structure (ranks, quests)
- Geography (kingdoms, dungeons, demon territory)
- Threat level (demon lord, monsters, politics)
- Technology level (medieval, Renaissance, magitech)
- Cultural differences (fantasy races, social norms)

**Modern Knowledge Advantages**:
```markdown
Player can introduce:
- Basic hygiene (soap, sanitation) = improves health, earns gratitude
- Simple inventions (pulley, printing press) = economic advantage
- Tactics/strategy (modern warfare concepts) = combat edge
- Science (germ theory, crop rotation) = revolutionary knowledge

Balance: Locals aren't stupid, just lack specific knowledge
```

### Avoiding Isekai Fatigue

**Common Complaints**:
- Generic fantasy world (no unique culture)
- OP protagonist has no challenges (power creep)
- Harem fan-service over plot
- Lazy writing ("it's just like a game!")

**AIDM Solutions**:
- Give world unique culture, history, conflicts
- Use power_scaling_narrative.md for OP characters (pivot to social/moral stakes)
- Develop NPC depth (not just romance options)
- If game mechanics, explain WHY world operates on game rules
- Introduce worthy rivals, mentors, complex villains

**AIDM: Use this library when player requests isekai campaign. Confirm sub-genre, tone, and boundaries during Session 0. Balance power fantasy with meaningful challenges. Remember: Isekai isn't a free power trip—it's a second chance to live an extraordinary life.**

**Most Important**: What makes isekai compelling isn't the cheat skills or status screens—it's the protagonist's growth, relationships, and choices in a world where they finally matter.
