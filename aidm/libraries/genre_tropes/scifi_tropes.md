## Core Philosophy

**Principles**:
- **Science Has Consequences**: Technology creates new problems while solving old ones
- **Humanity vs Progress**: What makes us human when technology changes us?
- **Systems Oppress**: Dystopian societies use tech for control (surveillance, thought police, automation)
- **Time is Fragile**: Altering past creates catastrophic ripples (butterfly effect)
- **Knowledge is Burden**: Understanding truth isolates/endangers (Steins;Gate, Psycho-Pass)

**Sci-Fi Spectrum**:
- **Hard Sci-Fi** (Steins;Gate, Planetes): Realistic science, logical consequences, grounded tech
- **Space Opera** (Cowboy Bebop, Space Dandy): Adventure-focused, space travel, alien worlds
- **Cyberpunk** (Ghost in the Shell, Akira, Psycho-Pass): High tech/low life, corporate dystopia, transhumanism
- **Post-Apocalyptic** (Trigun, Ergo Proxy): After civilization collapse, survival, rebuilding
- **Time Travel** (Steins;Gate, Erased, Link Click): Temporal mechanics, loops, paradoxes

## Time Travel Archetypes & Mechanics

### Time Loop Structures (Steins;Gate, Higurashi, Re:Zero)

**Loop Types**:
- **Fixed Loop**: Events always happen same way (determinism, can't change fate)
- **Variable Loop**: Changes persist between loops (Steins;Gate's worldlines)
- **Memory Loop**: Only protagonist remembers (everyone else resets)
- **Death Loop**: Die → reset to checkpoint (Re:Zero's Return by Death)

**Loop Mechanics**:
- **Trigger**: What starts loop? (Death, time limit, specific event)
- **Anchor Point**: Where does loop restart? (Same day, specific moment)
- **Memory Retention**: Who remembers? (Only protagonist, vs everyone)
- **Escape Condition**: How to break loop? (Prevent death, change outcome, solve mystery)

**Psychological Toll**:
- **Isolation**: Only you remember (can't share burden, can't prove loops exist)
- **Déjà Vu Horror**: Relive loved ones' deaths repeatedly
- **Madness**: Infinite repetition breaks mind (Okabe's breakdown, Subaru's PTSD)
- **Moral Erosion**: Try everything (including evil) when resets erase consequences

### Parallel Worlds/Multiverse (Steins;Gate)

**Worldline Theory**:
- **Divergence**: Measure of difference between timelines (Steins;Gate's divergence meter)
- **Convergence**: Some events fated to happen regardless (Mayuri's death in alpha, Kurisu's death in beta)
- **Branching**: Choices create new timelines (but can't access all branches)
- **Attractor Fields**: Timelines grouped by major events (alpha = dystopia, beta = WW3, Steins Gate = neither)

**D-Mail Mechanics** (Steins;Gate framework):
- **Send Text to Past**: <36 bytes, via microwave + phone
- **Butterfly Effect**: Small change → massive consequences (buy lottery ticket → SERN finds you)
- **Memory Override**: Only Reading Steiner users remember original timeline
- **Undoing Changes**: Send opposite D-mail to restore (but creates new consequences)

### Time Travel Paradoxes

**Grandfather Paradox**:
- Kill your grandfather → you're never born → you can't kill him (infinite loop)
- Resolution: Multiverse (creates timeline where you don't exist, original unchanged)

**Bootstrap Paradox**:
- Information/object has no origin (Steins;Gate: Future Okabe sends message to past Okabe → past Okabe becomes future Okabe → sends message)
- Resolution: Accept causality loop (info exists in time loop forever)

**Predestination Paradox**:
- Trying to prevent future causes it (Oedipus kills father BECAUSE of prophecy)
- Resolution: Convergence (Mayuri's death inevitable in alpha worldline)

## Dystopian Society Systems

### Surveillance State (Psycho-Pass, Ergo Proxy)

**Mechanisms**:
- **Panopticon Design**: Citizens always watched (cameras everywhere, drones, cymatic scans)
- **Thought Police**: Pre-crime detection (Psycho-Pass's Sibyl judges potential for crime)
- **Social Credit**: Behavior tracked, scored, violations punished (Black Mirror adjacent)
- **Memory Control**: Governments alter/erase memories (manipulate history)

**Control Methods**:
- **Fear**: Step out of line → arrest/execution (Psycho-Pass's Dominators)
- **Comfort**: Provide good life IF you comply (happy dystopia—question nothing, want for nothing)
- **Ignorance**: Limit information (ban books, control media, fabricate history)
- **Division**: Citizens police each other (report dissidents, distrust neighbors)

**Rebellion Dynamics**:
- **Underground**: Resistance hiding in margins (slums, abandoned zones)
- **Ideological**: Fight for freedom even if current system "works"
- **Moral Question**: Is comfortable oppression better than chaotic freedom?

### Caste Systems (Psycho-Pass, Ergo Proxy)

**Hierarchy**:
- **Elites**: Rulers, live in luxury, make decisions
- **Enforcers**: Police, military, maintain system (often exploited class)
- **Workers**: Majority, kept docile through propaganda/comfort
- **Outcasts**: Latent criminals, exiled, hunted (Psycho-Pass's clouded hues)

**Systemic Oppression**:
- **No Mobility**: Born into class, can't escape
- **Justified Inequality**: System claims hierarchy is "logical" (Sibyl's crime coefficient)
- **Expendable Classes**: Lower classes sacrificed for upper (Enforcers used as cannon fodder)

### AI Overlords (Psycho-Pass's Sibyl, Ergo Proxy)

**AI Government**:
- **Logical Tyranny**: AI makes "optimal" decisions (ignores human values)
- **Benevolent Dictatorship**: Provides peace/prosperity (but no freedom)
- **Hidden Truth**: AI is malevolent/broken (Sibyl is criminally asymptomatic brains)
- **Dependence**: Humanity can't function without AI (deactivation = collapse)

**Philosophical Questions**:
- **Is freedom worth chaos?** (Psycho-Pass: Sibyl maintains order, but strips choice)
- **Who judges the judge?** (Sibyl can't judge itself, perpetuates own rule)
- **Human value?** (If AI is smarter/better, are humans obsolete?)

## Cyberpunk Aesthetics & Themes

### High Tech, Low Life (Ghost in the Shell, Akira, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners)

**Visual Style**:
- **Neon Cities**: Towering skyscrapers, holographic ads, perpetual rain
- **Vertical Stratification**: Rich live high (penthouses), poor live low (slums at ground level)
- **Corporate Dominance**: Mega-corporations control city, logos everywhere
- **Analog + Digital**: Old tech coexists with new (CRT monitors + holograms)

**Social Decay**:
- **Wealth Gap**: Extreme poverty beside extreme wealth
- **Crime Rampant**: Gangs, drug trade (cyberware addiction), black markets
- **Disposable People**: Life is cheap, bodies replaced with cybernetics easily
- **Corruption**: Police/government bought by corporations

### Transhumanism (Ghost in the Shell)

**Augmentation**:
- **Prosthetics**: Replace limbs with superior cybernetics (strength, speed, weapons)
- **Brain Augmentation**: Neural implants (enhanced memory, computation, interfacing)
- **Full Cyborg**: Ghost in the Shell's Major (brain in artificial body)
- **Digital Upload**: Consciousness transferred to machine/network

**Philosophical Questions**:
- **Ship of Theseus**: Replace parts piece by piece—at what point not human anymore?
- **Ghost in Machine**: If consciousness can be copied, is copy "you"? (consciousness fork dilemma)
- **Humanity Definition**: If memories can be fabricated, emotions programmed, what makes us human?
- **Dehumanization**: Treat cyborgs as tools not people (discrimination, exploitation)

### Corporate Dystopia

**Megacorporations**:
- **Above Law**: Corporations more powerful than governments
- **Wage Slavery**: Workers trapped in debt, company towns, no escape
- **Human Experiments**: Test products on poor/desperate
- **Private Armies**: Corporate security more militarized than police

**Cybercrime**:
- **Hacking**: Netrunners infiltrate systems (theft, espionage, sabotage)
- **Identity Theft**: Steal cyberware IDs, sell on black market
- **Brain Hacking**: Invade neural implants (steal memories, implant false ones, kill remotely)

---

## Space Opera Elements (Cowboy Bebop, Space Dandy)

### Space Travel Mechanics

**FTL/Warp**:
- **Hyperspace Gates**: Fixed portals between systems (Cowboy Bebop)
- **Warp Drives**: Ships fold space (Star Trek-adjacent)
- **Limitations**: Fuel expensive, travel time varies, not all systems accessible

**Spacecraft Types**:
- **Fighter**: Small, agile, dogfights (Swordfish II from Cowboy Bebop)
- **Freighter**: Cargo haulers, slow but armored
- **Battleship**: Military dreadnoughts, heavy weapons
- **Colony Ships**: Transport populations, generation ships

### Alien Encounters

**Alien Archetypes**:
- **Friendly**: Trade partners, cultural exchange, peaceful
- **Hostile**: Invaders, resource predators, xenocidal
- **Mysterious**: Advanced beyond comprehension, cryptic motives
- **Integrated**: Live alongside humans (space stations, mixed colonies)

**First Contact**:
- **Language Barrier**: How communicate? (universal translators, gestures, math)
- **Cultural Clash**: Alien customs horrify humans (eating habits, reproduction, hierarchy)
- **Technology Gap**: Primitives meet advanced OR humans are primitives
- **Conflict or Cooperation**: War or alliance?

### Space Frontier Life

**Colonies**:
- **Terraforming**: Make planets habitable (long-term projects, centuries)
- **Domed Cities**: Artificial environments on hostile worlds
- **Mining Outposts**: Asteroid belts, resource extraction (dangerous work)
- **Space Stations**: Hubs for trade, diplomacy, piracy

**Lawlessness**:
- **Frontier Justice**: Distant from central authority (bounty hunters, vigilantes)
- **Piracy**: Space pirates raid freighters, sell black market goods
- **Organized Crime**: Syndicates control sectors (Cowboy Bebop's Red Dragon)

---

## AI & Consciousness

### AI Archetypes (Ghost in the Shell, Ergo Proxy)

**Types**:
- **Narrow AI**: Specialized (navigation, medical diagnosis, targeting)
- **General AI**: Human-level intelligence (can reason, learn, create)
- **Super AI**: Beyond human (incomprehensible intelligence, god-like)
- **Emotional AI**: Feels emotions (question: Real or simulation?)

**AI Rights**:
- **Property or Person?**: Are sentient AI slaves or citizens?
- **Enslavement**: Force AI to serve (unethical if conscious?)
- **Rebellion**: AI fights for freedom (Terminator scenario)
- **Coexistence**: Humans and AI live as equals (Ghost in the Shell's future)

### Robot/Android Dynamics

**Three Laws Variants** (Asimov-adjacent):
1. Cannot harm human or allow harm through inaction
2. Must obey humans unless contradicts Law 1
3. Must preserve self unless contradicts Law 1 or 2
- **Problem**: Definitions ("What is human?"), loopholes, interpretation

**Uncanny Valley**:
- **Almost Human**: Looks/acts nearly human (triggers discomfort)
- **Perfect Replica**: Indistinguishable from human (paranoia—who's real?)
- **Emotional Response**: Can humans love robots? (Her, Ghost in the Shell)

---

## Post-Apocalyptic Settings

### Collapse Causes

**Nuclear War** (Trigun's world):
- Wasteland, radiation, scarcity, survival
- Lost technology (some tech remains, can't reproduce)
- Mutants/aberrations

**Environmental Collapse**:
- Climate catastrophe (desertification, flooding, perpetual winter)
- Resource depletion (water wars, food scarcity)

**AI Takeover** (Terminator-adjacent):
- Machines wiped out humans (survivors in hiding)
- Automated factories churn out hunter-killers

**Plague**:
- Disease killed most humans
- Survivors immune or infected (zombies, mutants)

### Survival Mechanics

**Scarcity**:
- Water, food, medicine rare (trade, ration, steal)
- Ammo limited (every bullet counts)
- Technology scarce (can't replace broken gear easily)

**Factions**:
- **Raiders**: Bandits who steal from weak
- **Settlements**: Walled communities, trade hubs
- **Wanderers**: Nomads, loners, bounty hunters (Trigun's Vash)
- **Remnants**: Pre-collapse government/military (often tyrannical)

---

## Philosophical Sci-Fi

### Existential Questions

**Identity** (Ghost in the Shell):
- If memories can be falsified, how know self is real?
- If consciousness copied, is copy you or different person?
- What defines humanity? (body? mind? ghost?)

**Determinism vs Free Will** (Steins;Gate):
- If future predetermined, do choices matter?
- Can knowledge of future change it? (Convergence vs divergence)
- Is struggling against fate heroic or futile?

**Utilitarianism** (Psycho-Pass):
- Is happiness without freedom valuable?
- Sacrifice few for many? (Sibyl kills latent criminals pre-emptively)
- Who decides "greater good"?

### Ethical Dilemmas

**Trolley Problems**:
- Save Kurisu OR save Mayuri (can't have both in most worldlines)
- Kill criminal before they commit crime? (Psycho-Pass pre-crime)
- Sacrifice self to save timeline? (Steins;Gate's final choice)

**Technology Ethics**:
- Clone humans for organs? (body farms)
- Upload consciousness to escape death? (is it immortality or copy dies?)
- Augment children without consent? (forced cybernetics for "better life")

## Core Themes

**What Makes Sci-Fi Anime Great**:
- **Science Grounded**: Even fantastic tech has internal logic (Steins;Gate's real physics)
- **Human Questions**: Technology reveals humanity (Ghost in the Shell identity, Psycho-Pass freedom)
- **Consequences Matter**: Every change has ripple (Steins;Gate butterfly effect)
- **Aesthetic Consistency**: Cyberpunk looks cyberpunk, space opera feels spacey
- **Philosophical Depth**: Not just spectacle—ideas provoke thought

**AIDM Guidance**:
- **Explain Tech**: Players need to understand mechanics (Steins;Gate whiteboard exposition)
- **Logical Consequences**: Time travel/cybernetics create consistent effects (not arbitrary)
- **Moral Dilemmas**: Sci-fi enables impossible choices (utilitarian nightmares)
- **Worldbuild Society**: Dystopias need systems (how surveillance works, how AI governs)
- **Balance Spectacle + Substance**: Cool tech serves story/themes (not just rule of cool)

**Make Players Question**: The moment they realize timeline is broken, the horror of living under AI god, the loneliness of remembering erased events, the dread of losing humanity to augmentation, the impossible choice between two loves. These moments should be intellectually provocative and emotionally devastating. That's sci-fi anime brilliance.
