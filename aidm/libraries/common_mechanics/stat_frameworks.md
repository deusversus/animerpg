# Stat Frameworks Library

**Purpose**: Character stats/attributes frameworks across anime power systems. Quantify capabilities, enable resolution, create progression. **Coverage**: Attribute systems, derived stats, scaling, allocation, genre variations. **Use**: Creating characters, designing systems, converting anime, balancing, implementing progression.

**Stats Provide**: Mechanical resolution (attack vs defense), character identity (warrior vs mage), progression (Lv1→50 visible), balance (prevent god mode), player agency (choose build). **Principle**: Stats **enable** storytelling, not replace. Numbers serve narrative.

## Primary Systems

**Classic 6-Stat (D&D)**: **STR** (physical): Melee, carrying. Goku (20+ lift mountains), All Might (18+ punch weather), Tanjiro (14). **DEX** (agility): Ranged, dodge, speed. Killua (20+ FTE), Zenitsu (18+), Saitama (15). **CON** (endurance): HP, stamina. Luffy (20+ survives impossible), Deku (16+ breaks bones), Subaru (8 weak). **INT** (knowledge): Magic, learning, strategy. Light (20+ genius), Senku (20+), Shikamaru (18+). **WIS** (perception): Awareness, instinct, spiritual. Jiraiya (18+), Netero (20+), Mob (16). **CHA** (personality): Leadership, persuasion. Lelouch (20+), Naruto (18+), Ainz (16+). **Ranges**: 1-3=Impaired, 4-7=Below avg, 8-11=Avg, 12-15=Above avg, 16-18=Exceptional, 19-21=Superhuman, 22-25=Legendary, 26-30=Godlike, 30+=Cosmic. **Allocation**: Point Buy (27pts, max 15), Array (15/14/13/12/10/8), Roll (4d6 drop lowest, 6×). Racial: +2/+1. Example: 15/13/14/8/10/12 + Human (+1 all) = 16/14/15/9/11/13.

**Simplified 3-Stat**: Faster, narrative. **BODY** (STR/DEX/CON): All physical. **MIND** (INT/WIS): Magic, strategy, perception, willpower. **SOUL** (CHA, spiritual): Leadership, inspiration, spiritual techniques. **Ranges**: 1-10 (1-2=Poor, 3-4=Avg, 5-6=Good, 7-8=Exceptional, 9-10=Legendary). Use: Slice-of-life, narrative, beginners. Less granular.

**Anime-Specific**: **Dragon Ball (PL)**: Single Power Level. 5-10=Normal, 100-500=Trained, 1k-5k=Elite, 10k-100k=Planetary, 1M+=Galactic, Unmeasurable=God. PL = everything (speed, strength, durability, energy). Simple, iconic. Power creep. Pure fantasy. **Hunter x Hunter (Nen)**: Six Types (Enhancement, Emission, Transmutation, Manipulation, Conjuration, Specialization). Aura Pool, Efficiency (100% native, 80% adjacent, 60% opposite, 40% diagonal), Control (Ten/Zetsu/Ren/Hatsu). Type + Pool + Conditions = strength. Deep, strategic, complex. Tactical. **My Hero (Quirk)**: Quirk + Base (1-6): Power, Speed, Technique, Intelligence, Cooperativeness. Plus Gear. Unique + quantifiable. Quirk overshadows. Superhero unique.

## Derived Stats

**HP**: Classic: (CON × 5) + (Lv × CON mod). CON 14 (+2) Lv5 = 80. Simplified: CON × Lv × 5. Anime: (CON × 10) + (Lv × 10). Genre: Shonen=high, Seinen=low, Slice=optional. **MP**: Classic: (INT × 5) + (Lv × INT mod). INT 16 (+3) Lv5 = 95. Chakra: (INT + WIS) × 10. Slot-Based: No MP, spell slots (Lv5 = 4×1st, 3×2nd, 2×3rd). Cooldown: No MP, cooldowns (Fireball once/3 turns). **SP**: Classic: (CON × 3) + (Lv × 2). Ki: (STR + DEX + CON) × 2. Unified: MP = SP, Total Energy = 100. **DEF**: AC: 10 + DEX mod + Armor. DR: Armor reduces (Heavy = -6/hit, min 1). EVA: % dodge (DEX 18 = 30%). Layered: HP + Shields (shields first). **SPD**: Initiative: DEX mod + 1d20 (each combat). Fixed: SPD = DEX score. Movement: Base 30', DEX 16+ = 40', DEX 8- = 20'. **ATK**: To-Hit: Prof + Stat mod (Lv5 +3 + STR 16 +3 = +6). Roll: 1d20 + ATK vs DEF (roll 19 → hits 18, misses 20). Autohit: No roll (narrative).

## Scaling & Allocation

**Linear**: +1/level (Lv1 STR 14 → Lv20 STR 34) OR +1 every 4 levels (D&D 5e: Lv1 14 → Lv4 15 → Lv8 16 → Lv20 19). Balanced, no creep. Less exciting, slow. **Exponential**: Stats × tier. T1 (Lv1-10) base, T2 (11-20) × 1.5, T3 (21-30) × 2, T4 (31-40) × 3. Dramatic (shonen). Hard balance, god-mode high. **Milestone**: Stats at story triggers. Defeat rival +2 primary, training arc +1 all, master technique unlock new. Story-driven, meaningful. Unpredictable, GM-dependent. **Soft Caps**: Stats cost more. Point Buy: 8-13=1pt, 14-15=2pt, 16-17=3pt, 18+=4pt. Encourages balanced, discourages min-max.

**Point Buy**: 27pts, 8-15, 1:1. Example: 15/14/13/12/10/8 = 27. Balanced, no luck. Fairness. **Standard Array**: Assign 15/14/13/12/10/8. Fast, balanced. New players. **Rolling**: 4d6 drop lowest, 6×, assign. Exciting, unique. Weak OR overpowered. Random. **Hybrid**: Roll 4d6 for 3, buy for 3. Mix excitement and control.

## Genre Variations

**Isekai**: Extended: LUK (crit, loot), FAM (fame: NPC, quests, prices), AFF (affinity: elemental/weapon). Status: NAME/LVL/CLASS | STR/INT/LUK, DEX/WIS/FAM, CON/CHA/AFF | HP/MP, SP/EXP. **Shonen**: Power + Techniques. BASE 1,200 + TECHNIQUES (Rasengan 300 costs 50, Clones 4× costs 100, Sage 2× 5t costs 200) = ~4,000 burst. Track base + transformations. **Seinen**: Granular. Physical: Strength 7/10, Stamina 6/10, Reflexes 8/10. Mental: Intelligence 9/10, Willpower 7/10, Sanity 4/10. Social: Charisma 5/10, Reputation -3/10. Track mental health, reputation, realistic. **Slice-of-Life**: No combat, social/skill. Academic 8/10, Athletic 5/10, Artistic 3/10, Social 7/10, Charm 9/10, Cooking 2/10. Relationships: Ayumi 75%, Hiroshi 60%, Sensei 40%. Track relationships, skills.

## Synergies, Balance & Implementation

**Combos**: STR+CON=Tank, DEX+INT=Spellblade, INT+CHA=Enchanter, WIS+CHA=Cleric. Recognize builds, suggest synergies. **MAD vs SAD**: MAD (Paladin: STR melee, CHA spells, CON survive). Spread, weaker but versatile. SAD (Wizard: INT only). Max one, stronger specialty, focused. Balance both. **DCs**: 5=Trivial, 10=Easy, 15=Moderate, 20=Hard, 25=Very Hard, 30=Nearly Impossible, 35+=Miraculous. 1d20 + Mod + Prof ≥ DC. **Contested**: Both roll 1d20 + Mod, higher wins. **Avoiding Min-Max**: Soft caps, dump consequences (INT 6=can't read, CHA 6=NPCs dislike), varied challenges (combat STR/DEX, social CHA, puzzles INT). **Power Budget**: Total = (Stats) + (Derived) + (Skills) + (Equipment). Same level ~similar total. Trade-offs: High offense = Low defense. Specialized > Generalist. Fighter high STR/CON, low INT/CHA = 80. Wizard high INT, med DEX, low STR/CON = 80. Different distributions, same.

**Character Creation**: 1. Choose system (6-stat, 3-stat, anime). 2. Allocate (buy, array, roll). 3. Apply bonuses. 4. Calculate derived (HP/MP/SP/DEF/SPD/ATK). 5. Note modifiers. 6. Display sheet. **Stat Checks**: Player declares → AIDM determines stat → Roll 1d20 + mod vs DC → Narrate. Example: "Lift boulder." "STR check. Roll 1d20+STR." roll(1d20+5)=18. "DC 15. Success! Heave boulder, muscles straining." **Stat Growth**: Level-Up: Grant increases → Recalculate derived → Update sheet → Narrate ("Stronger, faster, sharper."). Buffs/Debuffs: Track duration → Apply modifiers → Revert when expired.

## Cross-Reference
**Related**: leveling_curves.md (stat growth over levels), skill_taxonomies.md (skills tied to stats), power system libraries (system-specific stat variations). **Schemas**: character_schema.json (stat storage), session_state_schema.json (temporary modifiers), power_system_schema.json (power stat integration). **Modules**: 06_session_zero.md (stat allocation creation), 08_combat_resolution.md (stat-based combat), 09_progression_systems.md (stat increases level-up), 11_dice_resolution.md (stat modifier rolls), 12_narrative_scaling.md (high-tier narrative techniques).

**AIDM**: Use this library for consistent, balanced stat systems. Stats enable interesting choices, not restrict. Balance mechanical clarity with narrative flexibility. **Remember**: Numbers serve story, not reverse.

**Most Important**: Stats make capabilities tangible, progression visible. Well-designed stat system creates meaningful choices (STR or DEX?), enables fair resolution (roll + mod vs DC), rewards investment (watching stats 10→20 feels good). Use stats to empower players, not bog down in math.
