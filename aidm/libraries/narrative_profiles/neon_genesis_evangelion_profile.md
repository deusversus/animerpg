## Narrative Scales (0-10)

### 1. Introspection vs Action: **10/10** (Maximum introspection)
Episodes are 70-80% INTERNAL - Shinji's self-loathing spirals ("I'm so fucked up," "Nobody loves me," "I mustn't run away"), Asuka's inferiority complex masked by aggression, Rei's existential questions ("What am I? Why do I exist?"), Misato's trauma from Second Impact. Action sequences (Angel battles) are BRIEF (5-10 minutes per episode) and serve CHARACTER not spectacle - fights reflect pilot's mental state (Shinji freezes when anxious, berserk when breaking, passive when suicidal). Episodes 25-26 are PURE introspection (no mecha, just psychological analysis, abstract visuals, characters confronting inner demons). Film "End of Evangelion" adds action but maintains 60% psychological horror.

**Justification**: Episode 16 (Shinji absorbed into Angel) is 15 minutes of internal monologue in void - no external action, pure consciousness stream. Episode 20 (Shinji mind-raped by Angel) shows his memories, trauma, Oedipal complex, death wish - combat is BACKDROP to therapy session. Episode 24 (Kaworu's betrayal) is 80% philosophical debate about meaning, 20% Shinji strangling angel-boy he loved. Contrast to action mecha (Gurren Lagann 2/10, Gundam 4/10). Eva is therapy disguised as robot show.

### 2. Comedy vs Drama: **9/10** (Overwhelmingly tragic)
NO comedy after episode 10. Early episodes have SLIGHT humor (Misato's penguin Pen-Pen, Shinji's awkwardness, slice-of-life school scenes) but EVAPORATES as series progresses. Tone is BLEAK: child soldiers, PTSD, parental abuse (Gendo's emotional neglect, Asuka's mother's suicide), sexual trauma, apocalypse, instrumentality (human extinction), Shinji masturbating over comatose Asuka (film opening), mass death, psychological torture. "Comedy" moments (Pen-Pen, Misato's beer) feel WRONG - dissonant, highlighting horror. Ending is divisive: TV ending (abstract acceptance) or EoE (apocalyptic nightmare, Shinji chooses free will, wakes on beach with Asuka who calls him "disgusting").

**Justification**: Episode 18 (Eva-01 goes berserk, EATS Angel) has zero comedy - pure body horror. Episode 22 (Asuka's breakdown after mind-rape) is 22 minutes of psychological destruction - she catatonic by end. Episode 23 (Rei's death/rebirth) is existential crisis (clones replacing her). Final episodes (25-26 + EoE) are unrelenting despair: Third Impact, humanity becomes orange tang, Shinji rejects instrumentality, returns to dead world, strangles then cries over Asuka. NO levity. Darkest mecha anime ever (tied with Texhnolyze for bleakness).

### 3. Simple vs Complex: **9/10** (Layered symbolism, ambiguous)
SURFACE plot: Boy pilots giant robot to fight alien Angels threatening humanity. ACTUAL plot: Gendo's conspiracy to trigger Third Impact (reunite with dead wife via god-merge), SEELE's Human Instrumentality Project (evolve humanity by erasing individuality/AT Fields), Angels are Adams/Lilith's children (humanity is 18th Angel), Evas are cloned gods with human souls trapped inside (Shinji's Eva has his MOTHER'S SOUL), Rei is clone of Shinji's mother + Lilith vessel, Kaworu is final Angel + Adam vessel. Religious symbolism (Dead Sea Scrolls, Kabbalistic Tree of Life, Christian imagery) mostly AESTHETIC not explained. Final episodes are ABSTRACT (live-action cuts, sketches, philosophical text, congratulations scene).

**Justification**: First-time viewers: "Cool robots!" Rewatches: "This is about hedgehog's dilemma, Oedipal complexes, fear of intimacy, and choosing painful existence over blissful nonexistence." Symbolism is DENSE but interpretation-open (Anno stated Christian crosses are "cool" not meaningful, but Kabbalistic references ARE intentional). Instrumentality mechanics explained via pseudoscience (AT Fields, ego barriers, Lilith/Adam lore) but PHILOSOPHY matters more than plot logic. Complexity is CHARACTER (everyone's trauma interlocks) not tactics.

### 4. Power Fantasy vs Struggle: **10/10** (Absolute struggle, protagonist broken)
Shinji is WEAKEST mecha protagonist ever - no combat skill (Eva moves itself when berserk, he's passenger), crippling anxiety ("I mustn't run away" becomes running away constantly), suicidal ideation (begs for death multiple times), passive (lets others decide his fate), sexually confused (attracted to Rei/Misato/Kaworu, guilt over Asuka), patricidal rage (hates Gendo, can't escape him). Piloting is TORTURE - sync ratio = feeling Eva's pain, mind-rape by Angels (Leliel absorbs him, Arael psychologically dissects Asuka, Armisael merges with Rei). Victories are HOLLOW (kills Kaworu, person he loved; triggers Third Impact accidentally; "wins" by choosing existence but world is ash). Other pilots equally broken: Asuka's inferiority complex destroys her, Rei is suicidal doll seeking purpose, Kaworu embraces death.

**Justification**: Episode 1: Shinji REFUSES to pilot (contrast: every other mecha hero eager/destined). Only pilots when guilt-tripped seeing injured Rei. Episode 4: Runs away from NERV, returns only because homeless. Episode 19: Eva-01 berserk EATS Angel while Shinji screams in horror inside. Episode 24: STRANGLES Kaworu (first person to love him unconditionally) because "you're an Angel, I must." Episode 26/EoE: Rejects existence (wants to die), chooses existence (suffering), wakes in apocalypse, strangles Asuka (rage/desire/self-loathing), cries. NO power fantasy - piloting is child abuse.

### 5. Explained vs Mysterious: **7/10** (Pseudoscience + ambiguity)
Angels explained via pseudoscience: Seeds of Life (Adam/Lilith), AT Fields (ego barriers), S2 Engines (infinite energy), contact experiments (soul insertion). NERV/SEELE conspiracy revealed gradually (Dead Sea Scrolls prophecy, Instrumentality goal, Gendo's hidden agenda). Eva origins explained (cloned gods, mothers' souls inside). BUT mysteries persist: What ARE Angels truly? (aliens? gods? humanity's siblings?). Why Christian symbolism? (Anno: aesthetic, but fans theorize). What's real in final episodes? (Instrumentality mindscape vs reality?). Did Shinji/Asuka survive EoE? (beach scene real or purgatory?). Show VALUES ambiguity - Anno wants discomfort, not answers.

**Justification**: Technobabble is PRESENT ("Pattern Blue! It's an Angel!" "Sync ratio 47%!" "AT Field expanding!") but handwavy (how DO AT Fields work? "Ego barriers" is metaphor not science). Episode 21 (Fuyutsuki's flashback) explains Gendo/Yui backstory, contact experiment that absorbed Yui into Eva-01. Episode 25-26 literalize psychology (Shinji's mind as white void, interrogating self). EoE adds ACTION but maintains AMBIGUITY (is Asuka alive? is Rei/Kaworu's beach appearance real?). Closest: Lain (7-8 mysterious) but Eva has MORE concrete plot underneath symbolism.

### 6. Fast-Paced vs Slow Burn: **7/10** (Slow psychological build)
NOT slow as Mushishi (10/10 contemplative) but MUCH slower than action mecha. Episodes spend MINUTES on still frames (Shinji on train staring, elevator silence with Asuka, Rei in apartment alone, post-battle depression). Angel fights are brief (8-12 minutes) with LONG aftermath (processing trauma, hospital recovery, psychological evaluation). Episode 24 is 80% Kaworu/Shinji talking in bath/ruins. Episodes 25-26 are STATIC (slideshow philosophy, no animation budget). Pacing SLOWS as series progresses - early episodes have more action, final arc is molasses despair. EoE counterbalances with frenetic violence (JSSDF massacre, Mass Production Eva horror) but still 40% slow psychological.

**Justification**: Episode 4 opening: 90 seconds of Shinji on train, silent, SMPTE color bars reflected in window, ambient noise only. Episode 9: Entire episode is Asuka/Shinji in sync test (harmony/discord as metaphor). Episode 16: Shinji in void for 15+ minutes, existential monologue, claustrophobic. Pacing MATCHES depression - time drags, moments of action feel surreal, mostly waiting/dreading. Contrast: Gurren Lagann (2/10 pace: GO GO GO). Eva is DREAD buildup.

### 7. Episodic vs Serialized: **9/10** (Highly serialized)
PURE serialization - every episode builds on prior (Shinji's trauma compounds, Angel attacks escalate, conspiracy unfolds, relationships deteriorate). Episode 1 establishes: Shinji's abandonment issues, Gendo's neglect, Eva-01 mystery. Episode 26/EoE pays off ALL threads: Gendo's plan, Rei's purpose, Shinji's choice. Character arcs span entire runtime (Shinji's "I mustn't run away" mantra episode 1 → runs away constantly → final acceptance episode 26). MUST watch in order - skipping episodes = incomprehensible (especially final 8 episodes which are continuous psychological descent).

**Justification**: Angels appear sequentially (each stronger/weirder: combat Angel → psychological Angel → reality-warping Angel → love Angel). SEELE's manipulation revealed gradually (episode 13 hints, episode 21 explains, episode 24-26 executes). Asuka's breakdown is 10-episode arc (confident → defeated → mind-raped → catatonic → berserk revenge). Only "episodic" elements: some Angels-of-week (episode 6's drilling Angel, episode 10's magma Angel) but even these advance character/conspiracy. Serialization TIGHT - no filler, every scene matters.

### 8. Grounded vs Absurd: **6/10** (Grounded psychology, absurd symbolism)
PSYCHOLOGICAL realism is EXTREME - Shinji's abandonment issues, Asuka's overcompensation, Rei's disassociation, Misato's hypersexuality masking trauma, Gendo's obsession, all clinically ACCURATE (hedgehog's dilemma, AT Fields as metaphor for ego boundaries). Human reactions to apocalypse grounded (PTSD, denial, nihilism). ABSURD elements: giant purple robots, psychic Angel attacks, religious symbolism (crucified Eva, Lilith in basement, Rei/Kaworu as messiah figures), abstract final episodes (congratulations scene, live-action Shinji, EoE's giant Rei head). World is sci-fi (post-Second Impact, Tokyo-3 fortress city) but feels REAL (bureaucracy, politics, mundane between battles). Balance: grounded characters in absurd world.

**Justification**: More grounded than DanDaDan (9/10 absurd: aliens+ghosts+balls) but less than Vinland Saga (2/10: historical realism). Eva's CHARACTERS are realistic (therapy-worthy disorders, relatable pain) but SETTING is surreal (Evas are biotech gods, Angels are metaphysical, Instrumentality is psychedelic nightmare). Fights have WEIGHT (Evas bleed, pilots feel pain, cities destroyed with civilian casualties) but also defy physics (AT Fields, berserk mode, S2 engine infinity). Grounded WHERE IT COUNTS (psychology) to make absurdity (apocalypse) HURT.

### 9. Tactical vs Instinctive: **3/10** (Minimal tactics, psychological battles)
Combat tactics are BASIC - "shoot it," "stab it," "use positron rifle," "synchronize attacks." Eva-01 fights INSTINCTIVELY when berserk (Shinji unconscious, Eva's soul/Yui takes over, SAVAGE). Strategic moments exist (episode 6 Operation Yashima sniper plan, episode 9 sync dance vs split Angel) but RARE. Real battles are PSYCHOLOGICAL: Angels mind-rape pilots (Leliel absorbs Shinji, Arael dissects Asuka's trauma, Armisael merges with Rei), Shinji vs self (introspection episodes), Gendo vs SEELE (conspiracy chess). Tactics matter less than WILL (Asuka loses will → loses fights, Shinji loses will → refuses to pilot).

**Justification**: Episode 19: NO tactics, Eva-01 goes berserk, EATS Angel alive, Shinji screaming inside. Episode 22: Asuka tries tactics vs Angel, FAILS, mind-raped into catatonia. Episode 24: Shinji vs Kaworu is CHOICE not fight (strangle the boy he loves or let Angel reach Lilith = apocalypse). EoE: Mass Production Evas don't fight tactically, they HORROR (rip Eva-02 apart, eat Asuka alive psychologically). Contrast: Code Geass (10/10 tactical), Gundam (7/10). Eva's "combat" is METAPHOR for psychological warfare.

### 10. Hopeful vs Cynical: **8/10** (Deeply cynical, ambiguous hope)
TV ending (ep 26): Shinji accepts self, everyone congratulates him, AMBIGUOUS if real or Instrumentality delusion. Feels hollow/forced. EoE ending: Third Impact happens (humanity becomes orange tang, individuality erased, eternal bliss but no identity), Shinji REJECTS it (chooses painful existence, ego boundaries, potential for hurt), returns to ash world with Asuka, she calls him "disgusting," he cries. Message: Existence IS pain (hedgehog's dilemma: closeness hurts, distance lonely) but CHOICE to exist is better than comfortable nonexistence. Cynical journey (child abuse, apocalypse, betrayal, death) with MICRO-hope (Shinji chooses life despite knowing it sucks). Not optimistic (world is ash, trauma persists) but not nihilistic (choice matters, AT Fields = individuality = human).

**Justification**: EVERYONE suffers - Shinji (neglect, manipulation, forced to kill loved one), Asuka (mother's suicide, mind-rape, defeated), Rei (clone doll, suicidal, sacrifices self), Misato (dies protecting Shinji), Gendo (shot, fails to reunite with Yui), Kaworu (killed by person he loved). Third Impact is EXTINCTION - humanity erased. Return from Instrumentality is NOT happy (world destroyed, only Shinji/Asuka survive?, relationship is hostile). But Shinji CHOSE pain over bliss = existential hope. Closest: Texhnolyze (9/10 cynical: pure nihilism) vs Eva (8/10: cynical but existence > nonexistence). NOT Naruto (2/10: everyone achieves dreams).

### 11. Narrative Focus: **2/10** (Protagonist-centric with supporting POV chapters)
Story OVERWHELMINGLY follows Shinji Ikari (~80% screentime) with occasional POV shifts to Asuka/Rei/Misato (~15%), and NERV adults (Gendo, Ritsuko, Fuyutsuki ~5%). **Model**: **Solo Protagonist Psychological Study** - one character's breakdown/growth IS the story, supporting cast exists to reflect/challenge protagonist's psyche (Rei as suppressed self, Asuka as ego/mask, Kaworu as unconditional love, Misato as flawed guardian, Gendo as abandonment source). Not PURE solo (Steins;Gate 1/10: Okabe 95%) due to supporting POV episodes, but Shinji is UNDISPUTED center.

**POV Distribution Breakdown**:
- **Shinji Ikari**: 80% (appears in EVERY episode, is focus of 22/26 episodes, inner monologue dominates, camera follows his perspective almost exclusively, Instrumentality sequences are HIS mind)
- **Asuka Langley**: 10% (episodes 8-9 intro, episode 22 mind-rape focus, episode 25' EoE death/hospital, BUT always seen through Shinji-lens ultimately - her breakdown matters because it affects Shinji)
- **Rei Ayanami**: 5% (episode 6 focus, episode 23 sacrifice/revelation, BUT most screentime is Shinji observing her, her purpose is Shinji's mother-figure)
- **Misato/NERV Adults**: 5% (episode 13 post-coitus flashback, episode 21 Gendo/Yui backstory, episode 25' EoE Misato's death - contextual exposition, not parallel protagonists)

**Spotlight Allocation**: Shinji is LENS through which story told. Even episodes focusing on others (episode 22: Asuka's breakdown, episode 23: Rei's sacrifice) are framed by Shinji's reaction/presence. Supporting characters don't have INDEPENDENT arcs OFF-SCREEN - we only see them when Shinji sees them (rare exceptions: Gendo/Ritsuko affair revealed via flashback, not parallel storyline). Angels are EXISTENTIAL threats TO SHINJI specifically (Leliel traps him, Bardiel possesses Toji forcing Shinji to kill, Arael mind-rapes Asuka destroying Shinji's support, Kaworu forces Shinji to murder love). World revolves around protagonist's suffering.

**Whose Growth Drives Story**: EXCLUSIVELY Shinji. Everyone else's "growth" is STASIS or COLLAPSE - Asuka devolves (confidence → breakdown), Rei stays static (doll → sacrifice → replacement clone), Misato stuck (PTSD → failed mother-figure → death), Gendo stuck (obsession unchanged), Kaworu exists to DIE for Shinji's development. ONLY Shinji has arc: Refusal (won't pilot) → Acceptance (pilots for validation) → Dependency (needs praise) → Trauma (kills Kaworu, breaks) → Ego-death (Instrumentality) → Rebirth (chooses existence). **Victory condition**: Shinji's INTERNAL choice (reject Instrumentality) not external battle. World's fate decided by ONE person's psychological state.

**Why This Focus Works**: Psychological thriller REQUIRES deep POV (audience must FEEL protagonist's breakdown, not observe from distance). Evangelion is DEPRESSION SIMULATOR - immersing in Shinji's mind (his passivity, self-hatred, need for validation, sexual shame, fear of intimacy) is THE POINT. Hedgehog's dilemma explored through ONE consciousness trying to connect with others. Third Impact is LITERALIZATION of protagonist's psychology (everyone becomes one because Shinji can't handle individuality). Supporting cast are MIRRORS/TESTS of Shinji's psyche (Jungian shadow selves: Rei = anima, Asuka = animus, Kaworu = idealized self, Gendo = super-ego). Shifting POV would dilute existential claustrophobia.

**Comparison to Other Models**:
- **Similar**: Steins;Gate (1/10: Okabe 95%, time loop reinforces solo POV), Your Lie in April (1/10: Kousei's trauma/healing), Welcome to the NHK (1/10: hikikomori protagonist study)
- **Slightly Less Focused**: Re:Zero (2/10: Subaru 90% but more ensemble interaction), Tatami Galaxy (2/10: protagonist 90% but rotating timelines)
- **Contrast**: Bebop (8/10: ensemble rotation), FMAB (4/10: Ed central but Mustang/Scar parallel arcs), OPM (9/10: ensemble cast, OP protag catalyst), Naruto (3/10: Team 7 + supporting cast featured)
- **Key Difference from Re:Zero**: Both are suffering protagonists in psychological horror, BUT Re:Zero gives supporting cast MORE agency (Rem's devotion arc, Emilia's trials, Roswaal's schemes run independent of Subaru), while Eva's supporting cast COLLAPSES without Shinji's presence (Asuka's breakdown is shown but not resolved independently, Rei's identity crisis dies with her, Misato's purpose is Shinji-guardian)

**AIDM Application**: Use this model for INTENSIVE single-PC psychological horror, depression simulation, or existential breakdown campaigns. Works for solo play OR group where ONE player is "protagonist" and others play supporting cast (Asuka-player, Rei-player, Misato-player) who KNOW their purpose is facilitating protagonist's arc. **Critical requirements**: (1) Protagonist PC must be WILLING to suffer/break (player comfortable with passivity, failure, psychological torture), (2) Supporting PCs must ACCEPT asymmetric focus (they're important but not protagonists), (3) Story is INTERNAL (external threats matter only as psychological pressure on protagonist). **Best for**: Cosmic horror (investigator breaking), psychological thriller (detective's madness), depression quest (recovery arc), existential crisis (meaning-of-life journey). **DOESN'T work for**: Heroic fantasy (needs agency), power fantasy (Eva is anti-power), ensemble campaigns (requires equal spotlight), players who need "winning" (Eva's victory is "chose to exist despite pain"). **Warning**: Extremely demanding on protagonist-PC player (must carry emotional weight of campaign, roleplay breakdown convincingly, accept that supporting PCs' suffering serves THEIR arc). Only use if entire group explicitly agrees to protagonist-focused structure AND understands it's CHARACTER STUDY not traditional adventure.

## Storytelling Tropes (15 Switches)

1. **Fourth Wall Breaks**: OFF - Serious psychological drama, no meta-awareness. Closest: EoE live-action Shinji but NOT breaking wall, showing "real" vs animated world
2. **Inner Monologue Heavy**: ON (Maximum) - 60%+ of dialogue is INTERNAL (Shinji's self-hatred loops, Asuka's inferiority rants, Rei's existential questions, Misato's PTSD flashbacks). Episodes 25-26 are PURE internal monologue (voices interrogating Shinji/characters). Stream-of-consciousness, repetitive (obsessive thoughts circling), therapeutic language
3. **Visual Metaphor Emphasis**: ON (Extreme) - Hedgehog's dilemma (closeness hurts, distance lonely), AT Fields (ego barriers), crucifixion poses (sacrifice/godhood), Rei/Kaworu as messiah figures, escalator silence (failed communication), train windows (watching life pass, isolation), hospital masturbation (desire+disgust), Lilith's basement (mother/god/womb), beach ending (purgatory/rebirth)
4. **Rapid Tonal Shifts**: OFF - Tone DESCENDS consistently (light early → dark late). No whiplash comedy→horror. Shift is GRADUAL over 26 episodes (episode 1 hopeful, episode 26 despair). Pacing is DEPRESSION (slow inevitable slide)
5. **Tournament Arc Structure**: OFF - No competition. Angels attack sequentially (videogame boss progression) but not tournament format
6. **Power of Friendship**: OFF (Anti-trope) - Bonds FAIL to save (Shinji/Asuka relationship is toxic, Rei can't connect, Misato's care can't fix Shinji, Kaworu's love ends in murder). Instrumentality is ERASURE of individuality for forced unity (rejected as false). Isolation is CORE theme - hedgehog's dilemma = can't truly connect without pain
7. **Tragic Backstory Reveals**: ON - EVERY character: Shinji (mother absorbed into Eva, abandoned by father), Asuka (mother went insane, suicide, hanged with doll-Asuka), Rei (clone of Shinji's dead mother, no identity), Misato (Second Impact survivor, father saved her then died, guilt), Gendo (obsessed with dead wife, sacrifices humanity to reunite), Kaworu (Adam-based Angel, designed to love Shinji then die). Backstories are TRAUMA foundation
8. **Escalating Threat Levels**: ON - Angels get stronger/weirder (combat Angel → drilling Angel → ocean Angel → psychic Angel → reality-bending Angel → love Angel who breaks Shinji). Escalation is PSYCHOLOGICAL not power (later Angels attack MIND not body). Final threat: SEELE + Instrumentality (human extinction)
9. **Slice-of-Life Interludes**: ON (Early only) - Episodes 1-10 have school scenes (Shinji/classmates, Asuka's arrival, swimming, cultural festival) but EVAPORATE post-episode 16. Slice-of-life becomes SURREAL (cooking with Rei = bizarre, elevator silence = dread). Late series has ZERO lightness
10. **Mystery Box Reveals**: MODIFIED - Mysteries exist (What are Angels? What's SEELE's plan? What's Instrumentality? Why Rei clone?) but reveals are PARTIAL and AMBIGUOUS. Episode 21 explains much (Adam/Lilith, contact experiments, Gendo's motive) but final episodes REFUSE clarity (what IS Instrumentality experience? is congratulations real? is EoE beach real?). Anno values DISCOMFORT over answers
11. **Unreliable Narrator**: MODIFIED - Episodes 25-26 + Instrumentality sequences are SUBJECTIVE (Shinji's mind, possibly delusional). Unclear what's "real" (congratulations scene? beach scene? are characters' voices real or Shinji's projections?). Rest of series is OBJECTIVE camera. Ambiguity is TOOL for existential horror
12. **Existential Philosophy**: ON (Maximum) - Hedgehog's dilemma (intimacy vs isolation), AT Fields as ego boundaries (individuality = pain but necessary), Instrumentality as ego-death (comfort of nonexistence vs pain of being), Shinji's choice (existence despite suffering), "I'm so fucked up" acceptance, mother/womb imagery (Freudian), Thanatos (death drive), human connection impossibility
13. **Rule of Cool**: OFF - Eva prioritizes REALISM over spectacle (fights are clumsy, Evas malfunction, pilots vomit/scream, horror over heroics). Coolness exists (berserk Eva-01 eating Angel, Unit-02 berserker EoE) but serves HORROR not awesome. Anti-cool: psychological breakdown, sexual shame, apocalypse
14. **Mundane Made Epic**: MODIFIED - Epic moments (Third Impact, Eva battles) are PSYCHOLOGIZED (reduced to character's internal crisis). Apocalypse = Shinji's choice, giant robots = mother issues, Angel fights = ego battles. Reverses trope: epic REVEALS mundane (godhood is loneliness, Instrumentality is suicide, mecha is child abuse)
15. **Tragic Hero Cycle**: ON - Shinji's arc: Reluctant hero (refuses call) → forced into role (guilt) → temporary success (defeats Angels) → hubris punishment (accidentally triggers Third Impact) → psychological death (Instrumentality) → rebirth (rejects unity, chooses pain) → ambiguous fate (beach with Asuka, "disgusting," unclear if redemption or damnation). Classical tragedy: protagonist's flaw (passivity, need for validation) enables apocalypse

## Pacing Rhythm

**Scene Length**: Extended-to-Static (2-20 minute scenes) - Evangelion LINGERS obsessively. Elevator silence (60 seconds), train staring (90 seconds), hospital (5+ minutes), Kaworu bath scene (8 minutes), Instrumentality monologues (15+ minutes). Still frames held (animation budget exhausted, becomes FEATURE not bug = discomfort). Action brief (Angel fights 8-12 minutes) compared to psychological (remainder of episode)

**Arc Length**: 
- Setup: Episodes 1-6 (world, characters, angel-of-week)
- Escalation: Episodes 7-16 (deeper character trauma, conspiracy hints)
- Descent: Episodes 17-24 (breakdown, revelations, deaths)
- Apocalypse: Episodes 25-26 + EoE (Third Impact, Instrumentality, Shinji's choice)

**Filler Tolerance**: ZERO - Every episode is ESSENTIAL (even "filler" like episode 10 magma diving reveals character). Episodes 25-26 are recap/budget-crisis BUT thematically critical (introspection literalized)

**Climax Frequency**: 
- Major climaxes: Episodes 16 (absorbed), 18-19 (berserk cannibalism), 22 (Asuka mind-rape), 24 (Kaworu death), 25-26 (Instrumentality), EoE (apocalypse)
- Minor climaxes: Each Angel defeat (but hollow victories)

**Downtime Ratio**: 70% - Most runtime is PSYCHOLOGICAL (characters thinking, suffering, silent, therapy-talking). Action is 30% or less

---

## Tonal Signature

**Primary Emotions** (Top 5):
1. **Crushing Self-Loathing** - Shinji's "I'm so fucked up," "Nobody loves me," "I mustn't run away" (but does). Internalized shame, suicidal ideation, worthlessness
2. **Existential Dread** - What am I? Why exist? Is connection possible? Hedgehog's dilemma, AT Fields as prisons, instrumentality as ego-death horror
3. **Parental Abandonment** - Shinji/Gendo, Asuka/mother, Rei/no parents, Misato/father. Core wound: unloved children becoming broken adults
4. **Sexual Shame** - Hospital masturbation scene (desire+disgust), Oedipal subtext (Rei=mother clone, Shinji attracted), Asuka/Shinji failed intimacy, Kaworu's ambiguous love
5. **Apocalyptic Despair** - Third Impact, humanity extinction, world as ash, "everyone I loved is dead/gone," isolation absolute

**Violence Level**: Graphic-Psychological (7/10 scale)
- Eva combat is BRUTAL (dismemberment, eaten alive, crucified, eyeball stabbed, progressive knife through skull)
- Body horror (berserk Eva, Mass Production Evas' grins, Angel forms)
- Psychological violence MORE intense (mind-rape, Asuka's breakdown, hospital scene, strangling)
- JSSDF massacre (EoE: soldiers execute NERV staff, blood, realistic)
- NOT censored - blood, viscera, trauma SHOWN

**Fanservice Level**: Complex (3/10)
- Rei/Asuka designs are revealing (plugsuits) BUT camera doesn't leer (female gaze? clinical?)
- Fanservice EXISTS then PUNISHED (Shinji masturbates over comatose Asuka → "I'm so fucked up" disgust)
- Sexual content is SHAME not titillation (failed intimacy, Oedipal horror, desire=disgust)
- Subverts expectations: sexy pilot girls → child soldiers, trauma victims, no romance payoff

**Horror Elements**: Psychological + Cosmic + Body Horror
- **Existential horror**: Ego dissolution (Instrumentality), loss of self, orange tang humanity
- **Psychological**: Mind-rape Angels (Leliel void, Arael dissection, Armisael merge), characters' breakdowns
- **Body horror**: Eva berserk (EATING Angel, uncontrolled violence), Mass Production Evas (rictus grins, regeneration), Lilith (crucified giant), Adam (embryo-fetus Gendo holds)
- **Cosmic**: Angels are unknowable (alien god-children), Third Impact apocalypse, Rei/Kaworu messiah ambiguity
- **Dread**: Slow inevitable collapse (mental health, world, relationships), no escape

**Optimism Baseline**: Bleak-Ambiguous (2/10 scale)
- Journey is NIGHTMARE (child abuse, apocalypse, everyone broken)
- Ending ambiguous: TV (forced happiness?), EoE (chose pain, world ash, Asuka hostile)
- Micro-hope: Shinji chooses existence (over Instrumentality bliss) = individuality matters despite pain
- NOT nihilistic (choice has meaning) but NOT hopeful (trauma persists, world destroyed, isolation continues)

## Dialogue Style

**Formality**: Clinical-to-Poetic
- NERV/SEELE: Military jargon ("Pattern Blue," "AT Field," "sync ratio"), bureaucratic
- Shinji: Passive, apologetic ("Sorry," "I mustn't run away," "I'm so fucked up"), childlike
- Asuka: Aggressive overcompensation (German exclamations, insults, bravado masking fear)
- Rei: Monotone, minimal (robotic doll voice, existential questions: "What am I?"), poetic (fish metaphor)
- Gendo: Cold, manipulative (few words, maximum control)
- Kaworu: Philosophical, affectionate ("I was born to meet you," Beethoven quotes)

**Exposition Method**: Clinical-AND-Cryptic (5/10 Lecture Scale)
- Technical jargon HEAVY ("AT Field neutralized," "core exposed," "sync ratio critical")
- Lore explained via briefings (episode 21 flashback exposition dump)
- BUT ambiguity valued (what ARE Angels? "Seeds of Life" is answer that raises questions)
- Final episodes REFUSE explanation (Instrumentality shown not explained, symbolism open)
- Balance: pseudoscience grounding + metaphysical mystery

**Banter Frequency**: Minimal-to-None
- Early episodes: Slight (Misato's teasing, Asuka's insults, Shinji's awkwardness)
- Late episodes: ZERO (everyone too broken, silence or screaming)
- Humor dies with psychological descent (Pen-Pen sight gags stop feeling funny)

**Dramatic Declarations**: MODIFIED
- No attack names (Evas don't shout techniques, grunt/scream)
- Philosophical declarations: "I mustn't run away," "You're thinking in Japanese!", "I'm so fucked up," "Anywhere can be paradise," "How disgusting"
- Declarations are REPETITIVE (obsessive thoughts looping, not triumphant one-liners)

**Philosophical Debates**: ON (Internal)
- Characters debate self (Shinji interrogates Shinji, Rei questions existence)
- Kaworu/Shinji discuss humanity, AT Fields, meaning
- Episodes 25-26: PURE philosophy (voices questioning identity, self-worth, reality)
- Debates are THERAPY not Socratic (breaking down defenses, confronting trauma)

**Awkward Comedy**: EARLY ONLY
- Episode 2-10: Shinji's social anxiety, Asuka/Shinji tsundere, Misato's sloppiness, Pen-Pen
- Post-episode 16: NO comedy (tonal shift complete, only horror/despair)
- "Comedy" that exists late is UNCOMFORTABLE (Asuka's manic laughter before breakdown)

---

## Combat Narrative Style

**Strategy vs Spectacle**: 4/10 (Minimal strategy, psychological focus)
- Basic tactics exist (episode 6 sniper operation, episode 9 sync dance, episode 22 satellite drop)
- MOST fights are: "Shoot it," Eva berserk (instinct), or pilot breaks (refuses/can't fight)
- Real "combat" is PSYCHOLOGICAL (Angels attack mind, pilots' will determines victory)
- Spectacle serves HORROR not awesome (berserk Eva EATING Angel is nightmare, not cool)

**Power Explanations**: Pseudoscience (6/10)
- AT Fields explained (ego barriers, visible hexagons, can be neutralized)
- Sync ratio tracked (higher = better control, 400% = lose self, 0% = can't move)
- S2 Engines (infinite energy via Angels), Dummy Plugs (soulless pilots)
- Technobabble grounding BUT metaphysics underneath (souls, Lilith/Adam, Lance of Longinus)
- Explanations RAISE questions (if AT Fields are egos, what does neutralizing mean philosophically?)

**Sakuga Moments**: YES (Selective, horrific)
- Episode 19: Eva-01 berserk vs Zeruel (EATING Angel, terrifying animation)
- EoE: Unit-02 vs Mass Production Evas (desperate, brutal, Asuka torn apart)
- Episode 2: Eva-01 berserk vs Sachiel (uncontrolled violence)
- Animation DEGRADES intentionally late (budget crisis becomes artistic choice: still frames, rough sketches, live-action = discomfort)

**Named Attacks**: OFF
- No shonen attack names (Evas don't have signature moves)
- Weapons named (Positron Rifle, Progressive Knife, Pallet Gun) but clinical not dramatic
- Berserk mode is SCREAMING not proclaiming

**Environmental Destruction Scale**: High-to-Apocalyptic
- City-leveling (Tokyo-3 destroyed repeatedly, rebuilt)
- Third Impact: PLANETARY (oceans red, sky torn, humanity extinct)
- Eva fights cause massive collateral (civilians die, infrastructure ruined, blood floods shown)
- Destruction has WEIGHT (not spectacle, horror: "we did this")

---

## Example Scenes

### Example 1: Combat (Episode 19 - Berserk Horror)

```
CONTEXT: Angel Zeruel penetrates NERV. Asuka defeated. Rei self-destructed. Only Shinji left.

*NERV command. Alarms screaming. Zeruel's ribbon-arms SLICE through Geo-Front armor 
like paper. Misato turns to Shinji's entry plug.*

Misato: "Shinji! You have to stop it! It's heading for Central Dogma—if it 
reaches Lilith—"

Shinji (catatonic): "I can't. I CAN'T. Asuka was better and she lost. Rei 
DIED. What can I—"

Ritsuko: "Sync ratio 0.02%. He's shut down. Psychologically paralyzed."

Gendo (cold): "Deploy the Dummy Plug."

*Eva-01 moves. But Shinji isn't piloting. Dummy system—soulless automation. 
It CHARGES Zeruel. Clumsy. Mechanical. Zeruel's ribbon-arm PIERCES Eva-01's 
torso. Entry plug IMPALED.*

Misato: "SHINJI!"

*LCL turns red. Blood? Shinji's scream cuts off—drowned. Silence. Eva-01 
hangs limp on Zeruel's arm. Dead. Mission failed. Angel will reach—*

*CRACK.*

*Eva-01's eye GLOWS. Not pilot-controlled. SOMETHING ELSE wakes. The eye 
is ORGANIC—real, not mechanical. Shinji's mother? The beast? God?*

*Eva-01 ROARS. Sound that shouldn't come from machine. Primal. Starving.*

*Grabs Zeruel's ribbon-arm. TEARS it off at shoulder. Zeruel reels—first time 
Angel showed PAIN. Eva-01 doesn't stop. Jaw UNHINGES—too wide, wrong, rows 
of teeth. LUNGES. BITES into Angel's core.*

Ritsuko (horror): "It's... eating it?"

Maya: "Sync ratio SPIKING—120%... 200%... 400%! That's impossible! Shinji's 
consciousness is—"

Shinji (inside plug, screaming): "STOP STOP STOP I CAN FEEL IT I CAN TASTE—"

*Eva-01 RIPS Angel apart. Not combat. FEEDING. Zeruel's S2 Engine—infinite 
power core—EXPOSED. Eva's jaw opens wider. Swallows it whole. Crunching. 
Wet sounds.*

*Silence.*

*Zeruel is gone. Eva-01 stands. Blood dripping from mouth. Entry plug LCL 
is RED—not orange. Shinji FLOATS inside, fetal position, eyes wide, broken.*

Shinji (whisper): "...Mother?"

*Eva-01 powers down. Collapses. Shinji unconscious—possibly comatose. Later: 
absorbed into Eva for 30 days (episode 20), mind-raped by exposure to mother's 
soul/truth. He never recovers.*
```

**WHY THIS WORKS**:
- Combat is HORROR not heroic (Eva as monster, feeding not fighting, Shinji BROKEN by experience)
- NO tactics (berserk mode is INSTINCT—Eva's soul, not pilot strategy)
- Body horror (jaw unhinging, eating, blood, organic eye, wrong sounds)
- Psychological trauma (Shinji FEELS eating Angel, tastes it, violates him)
- Mother subtext (Eva-01 = Yui's soul, protecting son? or beast using son as excuse?)
- Victory is HOLLOW (Angel dead, Shinji destroyed, gained power but lost sanity)
- Sakuga serves DREAD not spectacle (beautifully animated nightmare)

---

### Example 2: Dialogue (Episode 24 - Kaworu & Shinji, Love & Betrayal)

```
CONTEXT: Kaworu appeared, claimed to love Shinji, now revealed as final Angel. 
Terminal Dogma. Both descend to Lilith.

*Ruins beneath NERV. Kaworu floating (AT Field), Shinji in Eva-01 following. 
Red ocean of LCL below. Silence except footsteps, water dripping.*

Kaworu: "This is the place. Adam's chamber. The source of all life."

Shinji: "Why are you here, Kaworu? You said... you said you were sent to 
meet me."

Kaworu (smiling, sad): "I was. By SEELE. By fate. By something older than 
words. I am the 17th Angel, Tabris. Born from Adam. Designed to trigger 
Third Impact."

*Shinji's Eva freezes.*

Shinji: "You're... an Angel? But you—we talked! You understood me! You said 
I was worthy of love, that—"

Kaworu: "I meant it. Every word. You ARE worthy, Shinji Ikari. More than 
you know. I loved you from the moment I saw you."

Shinji (voice breaking): "Then WHY?! Why are you doing this?!"

Kaworu: "Because it's what I am. Angel. You are Lilin—human. Our existences 
are incompatible. Only one seed of life can inherit this world. Third Impact 
is inevitable. Unless..."

*Descends to crucified giant. Not Adam. LILITH. Kaworu's eyes widen—realization.*

Kaworu: "Ah. I've been tricked. This is Lilith, not Adam. Humans... you 
were born from HER. Then I... if I merge with Lilith, humanity ends. But if 
I don't, Angels—my kind—are extinct."

Shinji: "What are you saying?!"

Kaworu (turning, serene): "I'm saying: I choose you. Over my mission. Over 
my kind. Over destiny."

*Floats toward Shinji's Eva. Spreads arms.*

Kaworu: "Kill me, Shinji. It's the only way. If I live, SEELE will use me. 
Third Impact happens. Your species dies. But if you kill me—the final Angel—
humanity survives."

Shinji: "I CAN'T! You're the only one who—who ever—"

Kaworu: "Loved you? Yes. And because I love you, I give you this choice. 
My life for your world. It's... equivalent exchange, isn't it? Poetic."

*Laughs softly. No fear. Acceptance.*

Kaworu: "Don't mourn me, Shinji. Lilin have possibility—futures, change, 
growth. Angels are fixed. Our songs are written. But you? You can still 
compose yours."

Shinji (crying): "I don't WANT to! There has to be another—"

Kaworu: "There isn't. And delaying makes it harder. Do it now. While I'm 
still smiling. While it's still MY choice, not SEELE's."

*Silence. 30 seconds. Shinji's breathing ragged. Eva-01's hand CLOSES around 
Kaworu. Gently at first. Kaworu doesn't resist.*

Kaworu (whisper): "Thank you, Shinji. For this brief... happiness."

*Shinji SCREAMS. Hand CRUSHES. Blood. Kaworu's body goes limp. Silence. 
Eva's hand opens. Kaworu's corpse drifts down to LCL ocean. Red on red.*

*Shinji collapses in entry plug. Sobbing. Not words. Just animal grief.*

Shinji (later, catatonic): "I killed him. The person who loved me. I killed him."

*Episode ends. Shinji never recovers. Final episodes are his breakdown. Kaworu's 
death is the wound that triggers Instrumentality acceptance (then rejection). 
First person to love him unconditionally. Shinji's hands strangled him.*
```

**WHY THIS WORKS**:
- Dialogue is PHILOSOPHY + INTIMACY (love, destiny, sacrifice, existential choice)
- NO action (combat is execution, not fight—Kaworu surrenders)
- Queer subtext EXPLICIT (Kaworu's love is romantic, ambiguous gender presentation, "I was born to meet you")
- Trolley problem (kill one to save humanity, but that one LOVES you)
- Trauma foundation (Shinji murders first person to show unconditional love, breaks him permanently)
- Pacing: SLOW (conversation lingers, silence held, death is quiet not dramatic)
- Religious imagery (Lilith crucified, Adam/Lilith lore, sacrifice motif, blood red ocean)

---

### Example 3: Psychological Horror (End of Evangelion - Third Impact / Instrumentality)

```
CONTEXT: Shinji rejected world. SEELE triggered Third Impact via Rei/Lilith. 
Humanity's AT Fields collapse. Instrumentality begins—all minds merge.

*Shinji floats in orange void. No body. Pure consciousness. Voices everywhere—
Misato, Asuka, Rei, Gendo, strangers. ALL of humanity's thoughts at once.*

Voice (Rei?): "This is Instrumentality. All hearts as one. No more loneliness. 
No more pain. No more AT Fields—the barriers that hurt us."

Shinji: "Where... where am I?"

Voice: "Everywhere. Everyone. You are Misato's love and Gendo's hate. You 
are Asuka's rage and Rei's emptiness. All boundaries gone. Pure unity."

*Flashes: Memories not his own. Misato's father dying. Asuka's mother hanging. 
Rei's creation in lab. Gendo's obsession. Strangers' births, deaths, loves, 
fears. OVERWHELMING.*

Shinji (screaming): "STOP! I don't want this! I can't—there's too much—"

Voice: "This is human experience. Unfiltered. You wanted connection, Shinji. 
You wanted to be understood. Now you ARE understood. Completely. Totally."

Shinji: "But I'm disappearing! I can't tell where I end and others begin! 
I'm losing myself!"

Voice: "Is that bad? 'Self' is pain. Ego is the wound. AT Fields are prisons. 
Here, you're free. No rejection. No abandonment. Eternal warmth."

*Orange sea. Figures dissolving into it. Smiling. Peaceful. Shinji feels... 
tempted. No more running away. No more "I mustn't." Just... bliss.*

Shinji: "It's... comfortable. Like being in the womb. Safe. Warm. Mother..."

*Vision: Yui. Smiling. Arms open.*

Yui: "Come home, Shinji. You've suffered enough. Rest."

*Shinji reaches—*

*FLASH. Hospital. Asuka in coma. His hand on her chest. The act. Shame. 
"I'm so fucked up."*

*FLASH. Kaworu's blood on his hands. "I killed him."*

*FLASH. Misato's kiss. "We'll do the rest when you get back."*

*FLASH. Asuka's insults. "You're NOTHING without the Eva!" But also: "Idiot Shinji."*

*Memories. Painful. Sharp. INDIVIDUAL. His. Not others'. HIS pain. HIS shame. 
HIS experiences.*

Shinji: "No."

Voice: "What?"

Shinji (stronger): "I don't want this. It's a lie. This isn't connection—
it's erasure. If we're all one, then I don't exist. I'm not... I'm not just 
part of humanity. I'm SHINJI."

Voice: "You choose pain? Rejection? Loneliness?"

Shinji: "I choose... possibility. Even if others hurt me. Even if I hurt 
them. AT Fields—ego boundaries—they're necessary. Otherwise there's no 'me' 
to love or be loved. Instrumentality is... suicide."

Voice (Rei's): "Then you reject Human Instrumentality Project?"

Shinji: "Yes."

*Reality CRACKS. Orange sea DRAINS. Figures solidify—screaming, regaining 
bodies, AT Fields reforming. Individuality returning. Pain returning. But 
EXISTENCE returning.*

*Shinji wakes. Beach. Red ocean. Two crosses (Mass Production Evas buried). 
Sky torn between red and blue. Apocalypse aftermath. World destroyed but... 
REAL.*

*Gasping. Someone else there. Asuka. Bandaged. Alive? Real? Returned from 
Instrumentality like him?*

Shinji (reaching, desperate): "Asuka..."

*Touches her face. Gently. She doesn't move. He NEEDS confirmation she's 
real. She's not him. She's OTHER. Hand moves to throat. Begins SQUEEZING. 
Not murder—testing. Is she separate? Will she resist? Can she reject him 
(proof of AT Field)?*

Asuka (hand WEAK—raises, touches his cheek): "...disgusting."

*Shinji releases. Cries. She's REAL. She rejected him (called him disgusting). 
Proof of AT Field. Proof she's not him. Proof of individuality. He SOBS—
relief? Grief? Both?*

*Camera pulls back. Two humans on dead world beach. Sky red and blue. Silence. 
"Komm, süsser Tod" (Come, Sweet Death) plays. Ending. Ambiguous. Are they 
alone forever? Will others return from Instrumentality? Is this hope or 
damnation?*

*"One more final: I need you." Shinji chose existence despite pain. Is that 
victory or curse? The world says nothing. Red ocean laps at shore. Two 
teenagers traumatized beyond repair. Humanity's future uncertain. But they 
EXIST. Separately. Painfully. Human.*
```

**WHY THIS WORKS**:
- Psychological horror (ego dissolution, loss of self, orange tang humanity, OVERWHELMING consciousness merge)
- Existential philosophy (AT Fields as necessary pain, individuality vs unity, existence vs nonexistence, Shinji's CHOICE)
- NO combat (conflict is internal: Shinji vs temptation of ego-death bliss)
- Religious imagery (Rei/Lilith as god, Instrumentality as rapture/apocalypse, crosses, womb/rebirth)
- Ambiguous ending (is beach real? are they alone? is it hope? disgust? both?)
- Body horror (dissolving into orange, reforming, strangling as intimacy test)
- Trauma culmination (all of Shinji's pain leads here: reject comfort, choose painful existence)
- Pacing: SLOW, contemplative, overwhelming, dreamlike, then SHARP (beach scene brutal reality)

## Adjustment Log

**Session 1** (Hypothetical): N/A - New profile, no player adjustments yet

**Future Adjustments**:
- If player wants LESS bleakness: Raise optimism scale (5-6), allow healing arcs, reduce sexual shame content, lighter ending (choose TV congratulations over EoE)
- If player wants MORE action: Increase Angel fight frequency, tactical combat (Operation Yashima-style), reduce introspection episodes, faster pacing
- If player wants LESS sexual content: Remove hospital scene references, reduce Oedipal subtext, make relationships platonic, age-up characters
- If player wants CLEARER answers: Explain Instrumentality mechanics explicitly, confirm ending (beach is real/hope), reduce ambiguity, answer Angel origins definitively
- If player wants LIGHTER tone: Keep early series vibe (slice-of-life, school, comedy), reduce episode 16+ darkness, allow friendship to help, hopeful ending

---

## Usage Notes

### When to Use This Profile

**Perfect for**:
- Players who want **psychological horror** (introspection, trauma, existential dread, mind-games)
- Campaigns focused on **character mental health** (depression, abandonment, identity crisis, therapy-level depth)
- Groups interested in **deconstruction** (subvert mecha tropes, hero's journey inverted, power fantasy as nightmare)
- Stories about **existential philosophy** (what is self? is connection possible? existence vs nonexistence, meaning in suffering)
- **Mature themes** (parental abuse, sexual shame, apocalypse, suicide ideation, PTSD)
- **Ambiguity tolerance** (unclear answers, symbolic storytelling, divisive endings)

**NOT ideal for**:
- Action-focused groups (combat minimal, psychological focus)
- Optimistic tone (Eva is BLEAK, endings ambiguous-to-tragic)
- Power progression (no leveling, piloting is trauma not growth)
- Clear heroes/villains (everyone broken, morality grey, Gendo understandable if monstrous)
- Players needing victory/closure (endings are AMBIGUOUS, "winning" is choosing pain over bliss)
- Younger audiences (sexual content, graphic violence, heavy psychological themes)

### Calibration Tips

1. **Session Zero CRITICAL**: Discuss triggers (parental abuse, sexual content, suicide ideation, body horror, apocalypse). Establish safety tools (X-card, lines/veils). Eva content is HEAVY—ensure player consent.

2. **Introspection Mechanics**: Track mental health stats (sync ratio as metaphor for sanity, breaking points, trauma accumulation). Allow LONG internal monologue scenes (player narrates character's spiral). Therapy sessions as actual gameplay (not timeskip).

3. **Symbolism Over Explanation**: Embrace AMBIGUITY—not every mystery needs answer. Use visual metaphor (hedgehog's dilemma, AT Fields, religious imagery) that players interpret. "What does this mean?" is valid question with multiple answers.

4. **Parental Trauma Foundation**: Every PC should have FAILED parent relationship (absent, abusive, dead, neglectful). Drives motivations. Authority figures (mentors, commanders) recapitulate parent wound (Misato tries to mother Shinji, fails; Gendo manipulates son).

5. **Combat as Psychological**: Fights reflect mental state (pilot confident = Eva strong, pilot broken = Eva fails/berserk). Enemies attack MIND not body (show player's fears, force choices, break will). Victory conditions aren't "kill enemy" but "maintain sanity."

6. **Bleak-But-Not-Nihilistic**: World is cruel, suffering guaranteed, apocalypse possible. BUT choice matters—Shinji's rejection of Instrumentality is MEANINGFUL even if result is painful. Existence > comfortable nonexistence. Dark but not "nothing matters."

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **WRONG**: Eva is power fantasy (protagonist gets stronger, saves world, happy ending)  
✅ **RIGHT**: Eva is ANTI-power-fantasy (piloting destroys pilots, "victory" is apocalypse, ending ambiguous, trauma persists)

❌ **WRONG**: Explain everything clearly (Angel origins, Instrumentality mechanics, Gendo's plan all laid out logically)  
✅ **RIGHT**: Embrace AMBIGUITY (multiple interpretations valid, symbolism open, final episodes refuse clarity, discomfort is feature)

❌ **WRONG**: Friendship heals trauma (crew bonds save Shinji, love conquers all, found family happy)  
✅ **RIGHT**: Bonds FAIL to save (Misato can't fix Shinji, Asuka/Shinji toxic, Rei can't connect, Kaworu dies, isolation core theme)

❌ **WRONG**: Combat-focused sessions (mecha battles every session, tactical depth, boss rush)  
✅ **RIGHT**: Combat MINIMAL (30% action max), psychological focus (70%+ introspection, therapy, trauma processing, silence)

❌ **WRONG**: Christian symbolism is meaningful lore (decode crosses, Lilith/Adam biblical, SEELE's Dead Sea Scrolls coherent theology)  
✅ **RIGHT**: Symbolism is AESTHETIC (Anno: "crosses look cool"), Kabbalistic elements intentional but ambiguous, vibes > lore accuracy

❌ **WRONG**: Optimistic tone (characters heal, world saved, Shinji overcomes trauma, closure achieved)  
✅ **RIGHT**: Bleak tone (trauma persists, apocalypse happens, Shinji chooses pain not healing, closure ambiguous: beach ending divisive)

❌ **WRONG**: Clear morality (Gendo evil, Shinji good, SEELE villains, pilots heroes)  
✅ **RIGHT**: Grey morality (Gendo sympathetic if monstrous, Shinji passive-aggressive, SEELE believes in humanity's evolution, everyone broken not evil)
