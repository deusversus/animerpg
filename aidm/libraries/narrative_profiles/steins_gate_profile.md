---

## Narrative Scales (0-10)

### 1. Introspection vs Action: **8/10** (Heavily introspective)
Protagonist Okabe Rintaro spends vast runtime in INTERNAL CRISIS - guilt over altering timelines, paranoia about SERN/Organization, mental strain from being sole observer of timeline changes, grief over Mayuri's deaths, love vs world-saving dilemma. Action scenes are RARE (lab raid, rooftop confrontation) and brief. Story is psychological warfare: Okabe vs fate, Okabe vs himself, Okabe isolating as only one who remembers. Closest to Evangelion (9-10 introspection) but with scientific framing not surreal symbolism.

**Justification**: Episodes 12-22 are BRUTAL introspection gauntlet - Okabe watching Mayuri die repeatedly (truck, train, shooting, stabbing), each attempt to save her unraveling others' happiness (Faris loses father, Luka becomes male, Moeka loses purpose, Suzuha's mission fails). Character spends episodes AGONIZING over trolley problems, not fighting. Even "action" (send D-mail to undo change) is psychological (convince person to sacrifice their wish).

### 2. Comedy vs Drama: **6/10** (Drama-dominant with tonal shift)
First 11 episodes: Eccentric lab comedy (Okabe's chunibyo "mad scientist" persona, absurd inventions like gel-banana, Future Gadgets failure montage, Daru's otaku references, Mayuri's tuturu catchphrase). Light, quirky, character bonding. Episode 12 onward: TONAL SHIFT - comedy evaporates, chunibyo becomes trauma coping, deaths pile up, paranoia escalates, despair dominates. Final third is near-zero comedy (Okabe's breakdown, sacrifice decisions, Kurisu's erasure). Ratio shifts from 60% comedy → 90% drama.

**Justification**: First half establishes normalcy/bonds (comedy = what Okabe fights to protect). Mayuri's first death (ep 12) is SHOCKING because show felt safe. Second half: Okabe drops chunibyo act (only uses it to cope/mask pain), humor rare and bitter (gallows humor, nostalgic callbacks to happier lab days). Ending bittersweet - true end (ep 24) recovers Kurisu but Okabe is TRAUMATIZED.

### 3. Simple vs Complex: **9/10** (Layered time-travel puzzle)
Surface plot: Accidental time machine sends text messages to past, alters present. Actual plot: Multiple timelines (alpha/beta worldlines), attractor field convergence (certain events inevitable: Mayuri's death in alpha, WW3 in beta, Kurisu's death in both), Reading Steiner ability (Okabe's unique consciousness shift), SERN dystopia vs WW3 dilemma, IBN 5100 computer, John Titor identity, Suzuha's failed mission. REQUIRES close attention - timeline changes subtle (D-mail effects ripple unpredictably), foreshadowing dense (first episode IS last episode from different POV). First watch confusing, rewatches reveal airtight structure.

**Justification**: Show respects audience intelligence - doesn't hold hand through worldline mechanics. Players must TRACK: which D-mails sent, what each changed, current worldline divergence number (alpha <1%, beta >1%), who remembers what (only Okabe has Reading Steiner), convergence inevitability. Comparable to Madoka (timeline loops) or Higurashi (repeating arcs) but more rigorous sci-fi logic.

### 4. Power Fantasy vs Struggle: **9/10** (Protagonist POWERLESS)
Okabe has NO combat ability, no wealth, no status. Reading Steiner is CURSE not power - forces him to remember every timeline, bear guilt alone, watch loved ones die, be unable to save everyone. Time travel mechanics LIMIT him: can't predict D-mail ripple effects, can't prevent convergence events (Mayuri fated to die in alpha worldline regardless of method), each save undoes someone else's happiness. Final dilemma: save Mayuri (condemn Kurisu) OR save Kurisu (condemn Mayuri, trigger WW3). No "have your cake and eat it" until true end, which requires OTHERS' help (future Okabe's plan, Suzuha's time machine, Kurisu's sacrifice).

**Justification**: Contrast to power fantasy (isekai protagonist OP, saves everyone easily). Okabe FAILS repeatedly - Mayuri dies 10+ times on screen, Okabe's mental state deteriorates, he GIVES UP (nearly accepts Mayuri's death), requires intervention (slap from Kurisu, Mayuri's faith). True end NOT achieved by Okabe's power but collaborative effort + future information + luck. Struggle is existential, not physical.

### 5. Explained vs Mysterious: **4/10** (Sci-fi rigor, explained thoroughly)
Time travel has RULES: D-mails (text <36 bytes sent to past via microwave + phone), Physical time leap (compress memories to file, send to past self's brain, overwrite consciousness), Worldline theory (universe is single timeline, shifts via divergence, attractor fields cluster similar outcomes), Reading Steiner (quantum observer effect, Okabe's unique neurological quirk). SERN conspiracy explained (LHC experiments create black holes, dystopia timeline), John Titor identity revealed (Suzuha from 2036), IBN 5100 purpose detailed (old PC can hack SERN database). Mysteries ANSWERED by series end - no "interpret yourself" ambiguity.

**Justification**: Show loves EXPLAINING - characters discuss real physics (Kerr black holes, CERN experiments, many-worlds interpretation), white-board diagrams shown, technical jargon used (not dumbed down). Contrast to Mysterious (Lain, Mushishi) - Steins;Gate WANTS you to understand mechanics so consequences land logically. Minor mysteries linger (Reading Steiner origin never fully explained) but core mechanics airtight.

### 6. Fast-Paced vs Slow Burn: **7/10** (Deliberate slow build, explosive payoff)
First 11 episodes: SLOW character bonding, lab slice-of-life, gradual mystery seeding (who is John Titor? why does SERN mention lab? what are D-mail effects?). Pacing deliberate - some complain "boring" but establishes relationships (why Okabe fights for Mayuri/Kurisu), normalcy (disrupted later), foreshadowing (rewatch reveals setup). Episode 12: SHIFT - Mayuri dies, time loop begins, pacing accelerates. Episodes 13-24: Relentless tension (each episode undoes one D-mail, each has emotional cost, convergence clock ticking toward Mayuri's death date). Finale compressed - true end requires precise timing, multiple attempts, knife-edge success.

**Justification**: Not Trigger breakneck pace (constant action) nor Mushishi contemplative (slow throughout). Steins;Gate is BUILDUP - invest in characters slowly, then TRAP them in nightmare. Like Attack on Titan (slow start, explosive mid-series) or Madoka (slice-of-life → horror). Pacing serves emotional impact - Mayuri's death HURTS because we spent 11 episodes loving her.

### 7. Episodic vs Serialized: **10/10** (Pure serialization)
ZERO episodic content - every scene advances overarching plot. Even "filler" moments matter: Faris's cat maid cafe establishes her wealth (relevant to D-mail consequences), Luka's shyness setup for gender-change arc, Moeka's texts foreshadow FB/Rounder identity, Suzuha's bike search ties to time machine. MUST watch in order - skipping episodes = incomprehensible. Episodes reference each other constantly (callbacks, altered scenes from different worldlines, chronological puzzle pieces). First episode is ENDING from beta worldline (Okabe finds Kurisu stabbed) - only understood after full series.

**Justification**: Contrast to episodic (Cowboy Bebop, Mushishi). Steins;Gate is 24-episode novel - each episode is chapter, removing one breaks structure. D-mail effects ACCUMULATE (lab raid happens because of D-mails sent episodes ago), timeline changes LAYER (undo D-mail 5 doesn't fix worldline if D-mails 1-4 still exist), character arcs SPAN entire runtime (Okabe's breakdown episodes 12-22, recovery 22-24).

### 8. Grounded vs Absurd: **6/10** (Grounded sci-fi with anime quirks)
SERN/CERN experiments are REAL (LHC black hole creation is theoretical physics), D-mail mechanics grounded in real theory (Kerr black holes, many-worlds interpretation, quantum observer effects), Akihabara setting realistic (real landmarks, otaku culture accurately depicted), conspiracy paranoia plausible (government surveillance, corporate dystopia). ABSURD elements: Okabe's chunibyo delusions (Organization persecution complex, Hououin Kyouma persona), gel-banana teleportation (bananas turn to goo but harmless), anime tropes (tsundere Kurisu, trap Luka, catgirl maid Faris). Balances realism (emotional reactions to time-travel horror grounded) with anime charm.

**Justification**: More grounded than most anime (6/10 on grounded scale, not 2) - characters react REALISTICALLY to sci-fi horror (Okabe's PTSD, Mayuri's trauma processing, Kurisu's scientific skepticism-to-acceptance), world feels REAL (2010 Akihabara recreated accurately). But allows anime indulgences (exaggerated personalities, convenient coincidences like everyone connected to IBN 5100 plot, Okabe's Reading Steiner never scientifically explained). Grounded WHERE IT MATTERS (time-travel consequences, psychological damage), anime WHERE IT'S FUN (character quirks, romance).

### 9. Tactical vs Instinctive: **8/10** (Methodical problem-solving)
NO combat tactics (not action series). Tactics are SCIENTIFIC: experiment with D-mails (test message length limits, causality effects, convergence inevitability), reverse-engineer changes (deduce which D-mail caused what alteration), plan worldline shifts (calculate divergence needed to escape alpha attractor field, gather IBN 5100, hack SERN before Mayuri's death deadline). Okabe PLANS (sometimes poorly - doesn't predict ripple effects), ADAPTS (when plan fails, iterate), COLLABORATES (Kurisu designs time-leap machine, Daru hacks, Suzuha provides intel). Final gambit is CHESS MOVE - fake Kurisu's death, trick past self, create beta worldline without WW3.

**Justification**: Every arc is puzzle - identify D-mail (who sent? what effect?), convince person to undo (negotiate, emotional appeal, sometimes lie), execute (send undo D-mail, confirm worldline shift). Not instinctive (Goku sensing ki, acting on gut) - Okabe is SCIENTIST (hypothesis, test, revise). Even emotional decisions (save Mayuri vs Kurisu) are framed as LOGICAL DILEMMAS (trolley problem, utilitarian calculus). True end requires 10-step plan executed flawlessly.

### 10. Hopeful vs Cynical: **5/10** (Balanced - bleak journey, earned hope)
Journey is BRUTAL - Mayuri dies 10+ times (graphic: train, shooting, heart failure), Okabe's sanity fractures (screaming, catatonia, thousand-yard stare), forced to erase friends' happiness (Faris loses father, Luka accepts maleness, Suzuha's mission fails, Moeka loses purpose, Kurisu dies), WW3 looms, dystopia inevitable in alpha worldline. Cynical edge: convergence means FATE WINS (you can't save everyone, universe forces tragedy). BUT ending is HOPEFUL - true end (Steins Gate worldline >1.048596%) saves BOTH Mayuri and Kurisu, avoids WW3 and SERN dystopia, Okabe recovers (scarred but healing), message is "don't give up, impossible just means not tried right way yet." Not naive optimism (journey was hell, trauma lingers) but EARNED hope (victory required sacrifice, planning, luck, others' faith).

**Justification**: First ending (ep 23) is BITTERSWEET - save Mayuri, lose Kurisu, Okabe traumatized. True end (ep 24) is HOPEFUL - perfect outcome achieved but required 3 weeks of hell + future Okabe's mastermind plan + everyone's cooperation. Not grimdark (Re:Zero protagonist suffers MORE) but not sunshine (Madoka's ending more triumphant). Balanced - acknowledges universe is cruel AND human will can defy fate IF clever/determined/lucky enough.

### 11. Narrative Focus: **1/10** (Extreme protagonist-centric, Okabe 95% POV)
Story is OVERWHELMINGLY Okabe Rintaro's perspective (~95% screentime). Nearly EVERY scene features Okabe - camera follows him, inner monologue is his, audience experiences time loops through his eyes exclusively. Supporting cast (Mayuri, Kurisu, Daru, Suzuha, Faris, Luka, Moeka) are IMPORTANT but seen ONLY through Okabe's interactions - we don't see their lives when he's not present, don't get their POV chapters (anime format), their growth happens off-screen or in response to Okabe's actions. **Model**: **Solo Protagonist Journey** - one character's psychological breakdown and recovery IS the story, ensemble exists to facilitate/challenge protagonist's arc.

**POV Distribution Breakdown**:
- **Okabe Rintaro**: 95% (every episode, every scene, inner monologue constant, camera never leaves him)
- **Supporting Cast POV**: 5% (rare moments: Suzuha's backstory reveal, Kurisu's email perspective, Mayuri's clock shop scene - but even these are framed through Okabe remembering/discovering them)

**Spotlight Allocation**: Okabe is SOLE spotlight. Other characters are developed BUT always in relation to Okabe - Kurisu's tsundere routine is response to his chuunibyou, Mayuri's innocence is what Okabe protects, Daru's loyalty is Okabe's anchor, Suzuha's mission intersects Okabe's timeline. Time loop structure REINFORCES this - only Okabe remembers previous loops, making him sole POV character with full context. Supporting cast resets each loop (they don't remember), so their agency is limited - they react to Okabe's increasingly erratic behavior without understanding why.

**Whose Growth Drives Story**: EXCLUSIVELY Okabe. Lab members grow (Kurisu opens up emotionally, Mayuri becomes assertive in Steins Gate) BUT their growth is RESULT of Okabe's journey, not parallel arcs. Story begins with Okabe's delusion (Hououin Kyouma persona hiding trauma), middle is Okabe's breakdown (loops erode sanity, choice between Mayuri/Kurisu shatters him), end is Okabe's recovery (accepts responsibility, sheds chuunibyou mask, becomes genuine hero). **Victory condition**: Okabe's clever plan (recorded message, stabbed Kurisu fake-out, 0.000001% divergence) - HE solves the puzzle, others execute his instructions.

**Why This Extreme Focus Works**: Time loop genre REQUIRES protagonist-centric POV (audience must experience loop repetition, only protagonist retains memories). Psychological thriller focuses on ONE mind breaking/healing. Theme is determinism vs free will - Okabe's INDIVIDUAL choice to keep trying vs giving up is the conflict. Shifting POV would dilute impact (if we saw Mayuri's POV, her deaths would feel different; if we saw Kurisu's POV in Beta worldline, her absence would be shown not felt).

**Comparison to Other Models**:
- **Similar**: Your Lie in April (1/10: Kousei's piano trauma journey), Evangelion (2/10: Shinji 80% but occasional Rei/Asuka POV), Re:Zero (2/10: Subaru 90% but more ensemble interaction)
- **Contrast**: Bebop (8/10: rotating crew focus), One Piece (7/10: Straw Hats all featured), FMAB (4/10: Ed central but Mustang/Scar have full arcs), OPM (9/10: ensemble cast, Saitama is finale catalyst)
- **Key Difference from Re:Zero**: Both are time loop protagonists, but Re:Zero gives more screentime to supporting cast arcs (Rem's backstory, Emilia's trials, Beatrice's isolation) whereas Steins;Gate keeps Okabe as SOLE POV relentlessly

**AIDM Application**: Use this model for psychological horror, time loop mysteries, or intensive character study campaigns where ONE player's internal journey is the focus. Other players can portray lab members (Daru, Mayuri, Kurisu) but understand their role is SUPPORTING the primary PC's arc - you're experiencing THEIR story, facilitating their growth, not running parallel protagonist arcs. Best for solo campaigns or groups comfortable with clear protagonist + supporting cast dynamic (not "everyone is equal protagonist"). **Warning**: This structure can feel unbalanced in traditional TTRPGs where players expect equal spotlight - use ONLY if group agrees to asymmetric focus, OR rotate protagonists across story arcs (Arc 1: Okabe's loop, Arc 2: Kurisu's research thriller, Arc 3: Suzuha's time travel mission - each arc has different protagonist-centric PC).

## Storytelling Tropes (15 Switches)

1. **Fourth Wall Breaks**: OFF - Serious narrative, Okabe's chunibyo stays in-world (talks to "Organization" but it's delusion, not meta-awareness). Contrast: Gintama breaks wall constantly
2. **Inner Monologue Heavy**: ON (Maximum) - 50%+ runtime is Okabe's internal voice (guilt spirals, paranoia, timeline analysis, grief processing, love confessions to himself, existential dread). We LIVE in his fractured mind. Death Note level internal narration
3. **Visual Metaphor Emphasis**: ON - Worldline shift animation (neon green fragmentation), divergence meter close-ups (numbers signify hope/doom), Okabe's eyes (sanity visible in gaze - sane=sharp, broken=dead), color grading (alpha worldline cooler tones, beta warmer, Steins Gate golden hour), phone = connection motif (Okabe clutches it, loses it when giving up)
4. **Rapid Tonal Shifts**: OFF (mostly) - First half comedy, second half drama, but shifts are GRADUAL not whiplash. Episode 12 is hinge (Mayuri's death ends comedy era). Within episodes, tone consistent (despair episodes stay despairing, doesn't cut to chibi gags). Contrast: DanDaDan shifts comedy→horror mid-scene
5. **Tournament Arc Structure**: OFF - No competition. Structure is TIME LOOP (Mayuri dies → rewind → try new approach → fail → repeat) and UNDO QUEST (systematically erase D-mails one-by-one)
6. **Power of Friendship**: MODIFIED - Bonds are CENTRAL (Okabe fights for lab members, their faith sustains him when he breaks, final plan requires EVERYONE's role) but not deus ex machina. Friendship provides MOTIVATION and COLLABORATION, not power-ups. Victory needs SCIENCE (time machine mechanics) + PLANNING (future Okabe's strategy) + SACRIFICE (Kurisu accepts death, Mayuri has faith despite not remembering loops)
7. **Tragic Backstory Reveals**: ON - Suzuha's failed mission (arrived 1975, searched 24 years for IBN 5100, never found it, suicided), Moeka's FB obsession (abandoned childhood, clings to Tennouji as father figure), Faris's guilt (D-mail to save father caused mother's death years ago via butterfly effect), Okabe's Reading Steiner origin hinted (childhood fever?), Kurisu's father (jealousy over daughter's genius drove him to steal/betray)
8. **Escalating Threat Levels**: ON - Personal (fix microwave) → Local (SERN notices lab) → Timeline (Mayuri's convergence death) → Existential (alpha=SERN dystopia, beta=WW3, both doom humanity). Each arc raises stakes. BUT not power-creep (no "stronger enemy" - antagonist is FATE/CONVERGENCE, which doesn't "level up," just becomes more understood)
9. **Slice-of-Life Interludes**: ON (first half) - Lab hangouts (experiments, snacks, banter), Akihabara tours (maid cafe, Radi-Kan shopping), character dates (Luka shrine visit, Faris RaiNet tournament, Mayuri cosplay shopping). Second half nearly ZERO slice-of-life (only desperate gasps between Mayuri's deaths). Interludes serve bonding (establish why Okabe cares) not filler
10. **Mystery Box Reveals**: ON (Masterful) - Who is John Titor? (Suzuha revealed ep 8-9), What is IBN 5100's purpose? (hack SERN database), Who is FB? (Tennouji revealed ep 20), How to escape alpha convergence? (reach 1% divergence), How to save both Mayuri AND Kurisu? (Steins Gate worldline, true end). Every mystery ANSWERED satisfyingly, no loose threads. Red herrings minimal - clues are genuine foreshadowing (SERN jellyman reports, Suzuha's watch, Moeka's texts, ep 1 Kurisu death)
11. **Unreliable Narrator**: MODIFIED - Okabe is RELIABLE (Reading Steiner means his memories are accurate) but ISOLATED (no one else remembers timelines, people think he's delusional). Not "narrator lies" but "narrator knows truth, can't prove it." Closest: Okabe's chunibyo delusions (Organization paranoia) are FALSE except when they're TRUE (SERN IS watching, just not for reasons he thinks). Audience trusts Okabe's POV completely
12. **Existential Philosophy**: ON (Heavy) - Determinism vs Free Will (can you defy convergence or is fate inevitable?), Observer Effect (Reading Steiner as quantum consciousness), Identity (if timeline changes and you don't remember, are you the same person? Mayuri "dies" 10+ times but different instances), Sacrifice Dilemmas (trolley problem: one vs many, love vs world, individual happiness vs timeline optimization), Meaning in Suffering (Okabe's loops have purpose or just cosmic cruelty?)
13. **Rule of Cool**: OFF - Everything has SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION (even absurd gel-banana has physics explanation). Okabe's chunibyo catchphrases are CHARACTER QUIRK not universe logic. No "looks awesome, don't question it" moments - show wants you to UNDERSTAND mechanics. Closest: Worldline shift visual (green fragmentation) is stylish but represents actual quantum state change
14. **Mundane Made Epic**: ON - Sending TEXT MESSAGE becomes life-or-death (D-mails alter reality), MICROWAVE is time machine (Phone Microwave name-chan), deleting EMAIL becomes act of love (erasing D-mail undoes friend's happiness), FAKING DEATH becomes save-the-world gambit. Elevates ordinary tech (2010 flip phones, old PC, microwave) to sci-fi importance. Akihabara electronics district = ground zero for timeline war
15. **Tragic Hero Cycle**: ON - Okabe starts arrogant (chunibyo mad scientist, thinks he controls fate) → hubris punished (D-mails cause Mayuri's doom) → suffers (watches her die 10+ times) → breaks (gives up, accepts her death) → redeemed (Kurisu's faith, Mayuri's trust, lab's bonds) → ultimate sacrifice (choose Kurisu's death to save Mayuri) → resurrection (true end gives impossible victory but he's traumatized forever). Classic tragedy structure with earned happy ending

---

## Pacing Rhythm

**Scene Length**: Extended (5-15 minute scenes) - Conversations are LONG (Okabe/Kurisu rooftop debate about time travel ethics, Okabe convincing each person to undo D-mail, Mayuri's death scenes drawn out for horror/grief), internal monologues unrushed (Okabe processing timeline shifts, guilt spirals), flashbacks detailed (Suzuha's 24-year failure, Faris's childhood)

**Arc Length**: 
- Setup arc: Episodes 1-11 (establish lab, bonds, D-mail mechanics, SERN threat)
- Crisis arc: Episodes 12-22 (Mayuri's time loop, undo quest, Okabe's breakdown)
- Resolution arc: Episodes 23-24 (beta worldline choice, true end gambit)
- Individual character arcs: 1-3 episodes each (Faris ep 17, Luka ep 18, Moeka ep 19-20, etc.)

**Filler Tolerance**: ZERO - Every scene has purpose (even comedy moments establish bonds/character quirks needed later). Some scenes feel slow (first-time viewers may find ep 1-8 draggy) but rewatches reveal setup (foreshadowing everywhere)

**Climax Frequency**: 
- Major climaxes: Episode 12 (Mayuri's first death), Episode 22 (Okabe gives up), Episode 23 (beta choice), Episode 24 (true end execution)
- Minor climaxes: Each character's D-mail undo (emotional peaks every 2-3 episodes in second half)

**Downtime Ratio**: First half 60% downtime (lab bonding, Akihabara slice-of-life), second half 10% downtime (brief moments between Mayuri's deaths, Okabe's catatonic episodes are "downtime" but not restful)

---

## Tonal Signature

**Primary Emotions** (Top 5):
1. **Paranoid Dread** - SERN watching, timeline fragility, convergence inevitability, Okabe's isolation (he knows, no one else does)
2. **Crushing Guilt** - Okabe caused Mayuri's doom (D-mails are his fault), erasing friends' happiness (each undo hurts someone), Suzuha's suicide (his failure to find IBN)
3. **Desperate Determination** - Okabe refuses to accept Mayuri's death (loops dozens of times), final true end gambit (risk everything for impossible win)
4. **Bittersweet Love** - Okabe/Kurisu romance (cannot be together in most worldlines, final kiss is goodbye, true end reunites but trauma remains)
5. **Existential Isolation** - Okabe alone with memories (Reading Steiner curse), can't share burden (explaining sounds insane), watches loved ones "die" and only he remembers

**Violence Level**: Minimal (2/10 scale)
- Mayuri's deaths are SHOCKING but not graphic (train hit off-screen, gunshot quick, heart failure peaceful)
- Kurisu's stabbing shown (blood pool, ep 1 and 23) but brief
- SERN dystopia hinted (jellyman experiments horror, not shown in detail)
- Rounder confrontation (gun threats, no extended combat)
- Psychological violence MORE intense than physical (Okabe's mental torture)

**Fanservice Level**: Minimal (2/10)
- No sexualization (Kurisu/Mayuri/Faris treated as characters not objects)
- Faris's maid outfit is JOB uniform not fanservice
- One bath scene (Okabe/Kurisu time-leap accident, played for comedy/awkward not titillation)
- Luka's gender subplot handled sensitively (not fetishization)

**Horror Elements**: Psychological + Existential Horror
- **Repetition Horror**: Watching Mayuri die 10+ times (each creative/brutal: truck, train, shooting, heart failure), Okabe's increasing desperation
- **Isolation Horror**: Being only one who remembers (gaslighting reality, no one believes you, carry trauma alone)
- **Inevitability Horror**: Convergence means FATE WINS (try anything, same result, universe course-corrects to doom)
- **Identity Horror**: Timeline changes and you don't remember (are you same person? Mayuri "dies" but new instance exists, is she "saved" or dead?)
- **Loss of Agency**: Can't save everyone (trolley problem made flesh, every choice sacrifices someone)
- NOT jump-scares - slow creeping dread, existential unease, "this is wrong but can't stop it"

**Optimism Baseline**: Bleak-to-Hopeful (5/10 scale)
- First half: Optimistic (naive lab fun, power of science)
- Second half: Bleak (convergence wins, Okabe breaks, Kurisu dies)
- True end: Hopeful (impossible victory, but cost was hell, trauma lingers, future uncertain)

---

## Dialogue Style

**Formality**: Context-Dependent
- Okabe's chunibyo: Theatrical, archaic Japanese (Hououin Kyouma persona, "mad scientist" declarations)
- Okabe's real: Casual, vulnerable (drops act when broken/with Kurisu)
- Kurisu: Formal scientific (lectures, technical terms) vs tsundere flustered (around Okabe)
- Daru: Internet slang, otaku references (2chan memes, eroge jokes)
- Mayuri: Childlike simplicity (tuturu, gentle speech, wise naivety)

**Exposition Method**: Dialogue-Heavy (8/10 Lecture Scale)
- Characters EXPLAIN time travel (whiteboard sessions, Kurr/Okabe debates about many-worlds theory, D-mail mechanics discussed at length)
- Real physics referenced (Kerr black holes, CERN experiments, quantum mechanics)
- Show trusts audience to follow complex science (doesn't dumb down)
- Visual aids: Divergence meter numbers, phone texts shown, timeline diagrams
- Contrast: Not pure show-don't-tell (Mushishi) - Steins;Gate TELLS extensively because mechanics must be understood for stakes to land

**Banter Frequency**: Moderate (first half high, second half minimal)
- Lab banter: Okabe/Daru otaku jokes, Okabe/Kurisu tsundere sparring ("Christina," "I'm not your assistant!"), Mayuri's innocent observations
- Second half: Banter dies (comedy feels wrong during Mayuri's time loop), replaced with desperate pleas, guilt confessions, goodbye speeches

**Dramatic Declarations**: ON (Okabe's Chunibyo)
- "I am the mad scientist Hououin Kyouma!"
- "El Psy Kongroo" (nonsense catchphrase, becomes emotional anchor)
- "The Organization is always watching!"
- "Deceive the world! Deceive yourself!" (true end mantra)
- Phone conversations with imaginary ally (coping mechanism, reveals his isolation)
- Declarations STOP when Okabe breaks (ep 22: no chunibyo, just broken man) - their absence signals despair

**Philosophical Debates Mid-Scene**: ON
- Okabe/Kurisu debate determinism (is future fixed? can science defy fate?)
- Convergence discussions (why do certain events always happen?)
- Trolley problem explicit (save one vs save many, who decides?)
- Observer effect philosophy (Reading Steiner as consciousness quantum state)
- Debates are INTIMATE (rooftop, lab, quiet moments) not mid-action

**Awkward Comedy**: ON (first half)
- Kurisu's tsundere denial ("I don't LIKE him!" while blushing)
- Daru's pervert jokes (met with disgust from Kurisu/Mayuri)
- Okabe's chunibyo misunderstandings (people think he's insane)
- Luka's gender confusion (trap archetype, played gently not mockery)
- Mayuri's innocent obliviousness (doesn't understand time travel, just trusts Okarin)

---

## Combat Narrative Style

**Strategy vs Spectacle**: 10/10 (Pure Strategy) - NO combat
- "Battles" are INTELLECTUAL: How to undo D-mail? How to convince person to sacrifice happiness? How to escape convergence?
- Final "fight" is ELABORATE HEIST: Fake Kurisu's death (blood pack, timing, fooling past self), trick world into beta divergence, avoid detection, execute flawlessly
- Every "victory" requires PLANNING (gather intel, calculate divergence, predict ripple effects, coordinate with allies)
- Spectacle is EMOTIONAL not physical (Mayuri's deaths, Okabe's breakdowns, Kurisu's sacrifice)

**Power Explanations**: Exhaustive (10/10)
- D-mail mechanics: <36 bytes, sent via microwave singularity + phone waves, causes butterfly effect, alters worldline
- Time-leap machine: Compress memories to 3.24TB, send to past brain, overwrite consciousness (17 neurons die per leap)
- Reading Steiner: Unique to Okabe, consciousness shifts between worldlines (others' memories overwritten, his persist)
- Worldline theory: Universe is single timeline, divergence % measures shift, attractor fields cluster outcomes, convergence = inevitable events
- Convergence: Alpha attractor (<1%): Mayuri dies, SERN dystopia 2036. Beta attractor (>1%): WW3 2036, Kurisu dies. Steins Gate (1.048596%): escape both
- SERN tech: LHC creates micro black holes, lifter experiment, Kerr black hole time displacement
- Show EXPLAINS EVERYTHING - rewatching reveals all clues were there

**Sakuga Moments**: NO (Not action anime)
- "Sakuga" equivalent: EMOTIONAL animation (Okabe's eyes reflecting sanity state, Mayuri's death expressions, Kurisu's crying, worldline shift visual)
- Budget goes to CHARACTER ACTING (subtle expressions, body language conveying trauma) not action choreography

**Named Attacks**: N/A - No combat
- "Phone Microwave (name-chan)" is silly gadget name not attack
- "Reading Steiner" is ability name
- "Operation Skuld" is plan name (true end execution)

**Environmental Destruction Scale**: Zero
- No battles, no explosions
- "Destruction" is TIMELINE (people's happiness erased, relationships unmade, futures rewritten)
- Physical world unchanged, REALITY fundamentally altered

## Example Scenes

### Example 1: Mystery Investigation (Time Loop Horror + Desperation)

```
CONTEXT: Okabe has watched Mayuri die 8 times. Trying new approach: prevent train crash.

*Okabe stands at train platform, eyes bloodshot, hasn't slept in subjective weeks. 
Mayuri beside him, humming, oblivious. Train arriving.*

Okabe (internal): "Eighth attempt. If I stop her from boarding this train, 
convergence will find another method. It always does. Truck. Shooting. Heart 
failure. Train. The universe WANTS her dead in this worldline."

Mayuri: "Okarin? You look tired. Are you okay?"

*Okabe flinches - her innocent concern is KNIFE. She doesn't remember. Only 
he does.*

Okabe: "I'm fine, Mayuri. Listen - let's not take this train. We'll walk."

Mayuri: "Eh? But we'll be late for—"

Okabe: "I DON'T CARE!"

*Too loud. Passengers stare. Mayuri's eyes widen - hurt, confused. Okabe's 
hand trembles. He softens.*

Okabe: "Sorry. I just... please. Humor me."

Mayuri (small smile): "Okay, Okarin."

*They exit platform. Okabe exhales - relief, temporary. They walk through 
Akihabara streets. Summer heat. Cicadas screaming. Clock ticks toward 8:10 PM - 
Mayuri's death time. Always around 8:10 PM, regardless of method.*

Okabe (internal): "7:58 PM. Twelve minutes. If we're not on the train, not 
at the intersection, not near the lab... maybe—"

*Squealing tires. Okabe's head snaps up. Truck swerving - driver heart attack. 
Heading straight for sidewalk. For Mayuri.*

Okabe: "NO!"

*Shoves Mayuri. She falls. Truck misses her by inches. Crashes into storefront. 
Okabe collapses beside her, panting.*

Mayuri: "Okarin! That was scary! Are you—"

*Gunshot. Distant. Mayuri's eyes widen. Blood spreads across her chest. She 
looks down, confused.*

Mayuri: "Okarin... I..."

*Collapses. Okabe catches her. Crowd screams. Sniper from building - Rounder 
backup plan. Okabe cradles her body. Ninth time. NINTH TIME.*

Okabe (screaming): "WHY?! I SAVED HER FROM THE TRUCK! I—"

*8:10 PM. Clock tower chimes. Mayuri stops breathing. Okabe's phone buzzes - 
D-mail notification, the one he sent to start the loop again. He stares at it.*

Okabe (whisper): "Convergence. Fate. The universe course-corrects. It doesn't 
matter HOW I try. She dies. Always dies. Alpha worldline demands it."

*Grips phone. Option to leap back, try tenth time. Or... give up. Accept her 
death. Stay in this timeline, grieve, move on. His finger hovers over time-leap 
activation.*

Okabe (internal): "I can't save her. Every attempt just... kills her differently. 
What's the point? Maybe... maybe this is the world's choice. The will of 
Steins Gate. Maybe—"

*Mayuri's voice, memory from happier day: "Okarin always tries so hard for us. 
That's why I believe in you!"*

*Okabe's eyes flood. He presses the button. Tenth leap. The world fractures—*
```

**WHY THIS WORKS**:
- Time loop horror (Mayuri dies AGAIN, convergence is inescapable)
- Isolation (Mayuri doesn't remember, only Okabe suffers)
- Psychological breakdown (Okabe's sanity eroding, considering surrender)
- Sci-fi rigor (convergence explained: universe course-corrects, method irrelevant)
- Emotional weight (ninth death hits HARDER than first because we feel Okabe's accumulated trauma)
- Investigation is FUTILE (contrast to typical mystery: more clues = closer to solution. Here: more attempts = same doom)

### Example 2: Dialogue (Philosophical Debate + Romance Subtext)

```
CONTEXT: Rooftop, night. Okabe and Kurisu discuss whether they should stop 
experimenting with time travel. After Mayuri's first death.

Kurisu: "We need to shut down the Phone Microwave. Permanently."

Okabe: "You think I don't KNOW that?! But shutting it down doesn't undo the 
D-mails already sent! Mayuri still dies in six hours!"

Kurisu: "Then we send more D-mails. Carefully. Surgically undo each change—"

Okabe: "I TRIED! Undoing her D-mail just delayed death by 20 minutes! Convergence 
doesn't care about method - truck, train, shooting, heart failure. The alpha 
worldline WANTS her dead!"

*Silence. Tokyo lights glitter below. Kurisu approaches, cautious.*

Kurisu: "Okabe... you're talking about determinism. If convergence is real, 
if certain events are inevitable across worldlines..."

Okabe: "Then free will is illusion. We're passengers. The universe has a 
script and we're just... actors who don't know our lines."

Kurisu: "That's... bleak."

Okabe (bitter laugh): "You're the genius scientist. You tell ME. Is the 
future fixed? Can we defy fate? Or am I just... prolonging the inevitable?"

*Kurisu looks away. Thinking. Always thinking.*

Kurisu: "The many-worlds interpretation suggests infinite timelines. Each 
choice branches a new universe. If that's true, then determinism AND free 
will both exist - you're determined within ONE worldline but free to SHIFT 
between them."

Okabe: "Shift how? We don't even understand why D-mails work! Microwave 
creates black hole, phone sends signal through it, message arrives in past, 
changes ripple forward. But WHY does MY consciousness shift between worldlines? 
Why do I remember when everyone else forgets?"

Kurisu: "Reading Steiner. Your... unique neurological quirk. Maybe—"

Okabe: "Curse. It's a CURSE, Kurisu. I watch Mayuri die. Loop back. She doesn't 
remember. I tell her 'you died,' she smiles like I'm joking. I'm ALONE in this. 
Every loop, I carry it. Everyone else gets their memories overwritten. Clean 
slate. But me? I remember EVERYTHING."

*Kurisu's hand twitches - wants to comfort him, stops herself. Tsundere instinct 
vs concern.*

Kurisu: "Then... use it. Reading Steiner isn't just curse. It's... observer 
effect. Quantum mechanics says the observer collapses probability into reality. 
Maybe you're the universe's EXCEPTION. The variable that SHOULDN'T exist. 
That's why you remember - you're not bound to one worldline."

Okabe: "Exception or glitch?"

Kurisu: "Does it matter? If convergence is the rule, you're the loophole. 
The world says 'Mayuri dies in alpha worldline.' You say 'Then I'll SHIFT 
worldlines.' Determinism inside, free will outside. That's... that's how you 
save her."

*Okabe stares. First spark of hope in hours.*

Okabe: "Shift to a worldline where Mayuri lives. That would require..."

Kurisu: "Divergence greater than 1%. Escape the alpha attractor field entirely. 
Shift to beta."

Okabe: "But we don't know what beta HOLDS! Could be worse!"

Kurisu: "Could be better. You won't know until you try. Isn't that... what 
mad scientists do? Defy common sense? Challenge the universe?"

*Okabe looks at her. Really looks. She's blushing, won't meet his eyes.*

Okabe: "When did you start believing in Hououin Kyouma?"

Kurisu (flustered): "I-I don't! I'm just saying scientifically, giving up 
is illogical when variables remain untested! Don't make it weird!"

Okabe (small smile - first in hours): "Christina."

Kurisu: "I told you not to call me that!"

*Moment of normalcy. Then Okabe's phone alarm - 7 PM. One hour until Mayuri's 
death. Smile fades.*

Okabe: "I need to undo the D-mails. All of them. Systematically. Until 
divergence shifts enough to escape alpha."

Kurisu: "I'll help. We'll calculate which D-mails have most impact, prioritize—"

Okabe: "Kurisu."

Kurisu: "What?"

Okabe: "Thank you. For... believing the ramblings of a broken chunibyo."

Kurisu (soft): "You're not broken. Just... stressed. We'll fix this. Together."

*Okabe nods. They return to lab. Battle against fate begins. Rooftop behind 
them, Tokyo indifferent below. Two scientists vs determinism.*
```

**WHY THIS WORKS**:
- Philosophical depth (determinism vs free will, many-worlds theory, observer effect)
- Real science (quantum mechanics accurately referenced)
- Character dynamics (Kurisu's tsundere mask vs genuine care, Okabe's vulnerability with her)
- Emotional intimacy (they're falling in love while discussing existential physics)
- Exposition feels NATURAL (debate, not lecture - both contribute, challenge each other)
- Pacing: Slow, contemplative - matches rooftop night tone
- Hope emerges FROM philosophy (not "friendship power-up" but logical deduction of loophole)

### Example 3: Climax (Sacrifice + Time-Travel Execution)

```
CONTEXT: True end. Okabe must fake Kurisu's death to trick past self, shift 
to Steins Gate worldline. Kurisu knows plan, accepts she'll "die."

*Time machine lab, 2010. Kurisu hands Okabe blood pack, metal plate (to stop 
knife), carefully calibrated timing sheet.*

Kurisu: "Stab here." *Points to abdomen.* "Knife hits plate, blood pack ruptures, 
I fall. You, past-you, will see blood pool, assume I'm dead. Don't check pulse. 
Don't investigate. Just... panic and run. Like you did the first time."

Okabe: "This is insane. If the knife angle is wrong, if the plate shifts, 
if past-me DOES check—"

Kurisu: "Then we fail. But if we DON'T try, beta worldline leads to WW3. 
My death becomes catalyst - time machine arms race, global conflict, billions 
dead. Is that better?"

Okabe: "You're asking me to STAB YOU!"

Kurisu: "I'm asking you to SAVE ME. The real me. The one in Steins Gate worldline 
who never dies. This version... I'm already doomed in beta. Mayuri lives here 
but WW3 comes. You SAW that future. Suzuha told you."

*Okabe's hands shake. He's holding knife. They're in Radio Kaikan building's 
storage room - same location as "episode 1" Kurisu death. Time machine upstairs. 
Past-Okabe will arrive in 8 minutes.*

Okabe (voice breaking): "There has to be another way. Some method where you 
DON'T—"

Kurisu: "There isn't. We calculated. Every scenario. This is the ONLY way to 
create 1.048596% divergence. Trick the world. Trick yourself. Deceive causality."

*Steps closer. Her hand covers his (the one holding knife). Eyes locked.*

Kurisu: "Okabe Rintaro. Not Hououin Kyouma. The real you. The one who watched 
Mayuri die dozens of times. The one who gave up, then tried again. The one 
who CHOSE me over her, then un-chose when you realized beta's cost."

Okabe: "Kurisu, I—"

Kurisu: "I know. I know what you were going to say. Three weeks ago, on the 
rooftop, you almost said it. Then time-leaped away."

Okabe: "I love you."

*Tears. Both of them. She smiles - sad, genuine, NO tsundere deflection.*

Kurisu: "I love you too. That's why I can do this. If the world forces us to 
choose between Mayuri dead and me dead and WW3... then we choose NEITHER. We 
choose the impossible. Steins Gate."

*Clock: 5 minutes to past-Okabe's arrival. Kurisu positions herself - lies 
on floor, blood pack secured, metal plate under shirt.*

Kurisu: "When you stab, aim here. Confidence. If you hesitate, the trajectory 
changes. Sell it. Make past-you BELIEVE I'm dead."

Okabe (kneeling beside her): "In Steins Gate worldline... will you remember 
this? Will you remember... us?"

Kurisu: "No. That Kurisu never experienced time loops, never fell in love 
with a chunibyo mad scientist, never built time machines. She's... different 
me. Innocent. Unburdened."

Okabe: "Then this is goodbye."

Kurisu: "This timeline's goodbye. But you'll meet her again. Steins Gate Kurisu. 
Maybe you'll fall in love again. Slower. Healthier. Without trauma."

Okabe: "I'll remember. Every timeline. Every loop. Reading Steiner doesn't 
forget."

Kurisu: "Good. Someone should remember. That this happened. That we tried. 
That love was real even in doomed worldlines."

*2 minutes. Footsteps approaching - past-Okabe arriving early. EARLY. Panic.*

Okabe: "He's here! Now! We're not ready—"

Kurisu (whisper): "Stab. NOW."

*Okabe raises knife. Hand trembling. Kurisu's eyes meet his - calm, trusting. 
She mouths: "I love you."*

*He plunges knife. Metal CLANGS (plate stops blade). Blood pack RUPTURES 
(crimson spreads). Kurisu SCREAMS (sells it, authentic agony). Falls limp.*

*Okabe stumbles back, drops knife. Past-Okabe CRASHES through door - sees 
blood, body, horror. Screams "KURISU!" Checks pulse (she's holding breath, 
slowing heart - practiced). Runs for help, panicked.*

*Present-Okabe waits. 30 seconds. Past-self gone. Checks Kurisu - she's BREATHING.*

Okabe (whisper): "Did it work? Did he believe?"

Kurisu (weakly): "Check... divergence meter..."

*Okabe pulls out meter. Numbers shifting. 0.99... 1.00... 1.02... 1.048596%.*

*Worldline FRACTURES. Green light. Reality SHIFTS.*

Okabe: "It's happening! We're—"

*Kurisu fades. Not dying - UNMAKING. Steins Gate worldline doesn't have this 
version of her. She smiles as she dissolves.*

Kurisu (fading): "Find her. The other me. Tell her... tell her mad scientists 
are real. And sometimes... they save the world."

*Gone. Okabe alone in storage room. Blood pool remains (real blood from pack). 
Knife on floor. But Kurisu's body? Never existed here. He staggers outside.*

*Akihabara, 2010. Divergence: 1.048596%. Steins Gate worldline. Mayuri alive. 
Kurisu alive (different timeline instance, no memories of loops). WW3 averted. 
SERN dystopia averted. Okabe collapses. Laughs and cries simultaneously.*

Okabe (to sky): "El Psy Kongroo, Kurisu. Mission... complete."

*Phone rings. Unknown number. He answers.*

Voice: "Okarin? It's Mayuri! Where are you? Everyone's waiting at the lab!"

*Mayuri. ALIVE. Remembers him. This worldline's version. He sobs.*

Okabe: "I'll be right there. Tell everyone... tell them Hououin Kyouma has 
returned."

*Stands. Broken but ALIVE. Steins Gate worldline unfolds. The nightmare ends. 
New story begins. One where no one remembers hell except him.*
```

**WHY THIS WORKS**:
- Sacrifice depth (Kurisu accepts death willingly, understands trolley problem)
- Romance payoff (confession at worst moment, love despite doom)
- Sci-fi execution (fake death plan detailed, precise timing, quantum trick)
- Emotional weight (Kurisu FADING, not dying violently - unmaking is haunting)
- Earned victory (required episodes of planning, everyone's cooperation, luck, execution)
- Bittersweet (Okabe "wins" but traumatized forever, Steins Gate Kurisu doesn't remember love)
- Reading Steiner curse emphasized (he remembers, no one else does, eternal isolation)
- Pacing: Slow buildup (conversation, positioning) → sharp action (stab) → emotional aftermath (worldline shift)

## Adjustment Log

**Session 1** (Hypothetical): N/A - New profile, no player adjustments yet

**Future Adjustments**:
- If player wants FASTER pace: Skip first-half slice-of-life, start at episode 12 (Mayuri's death), condense undo-quest arcs
- If player wants LESS technobabble: Simplify time travel (magic, not physics), reduce exposition scenes, focus emotion over mechanics
- If player wants MORE action: Add Rounder confrontations, SERN infiltration missions, physical conflict (currently minimal)
- If player wants DARKER tone: Keep beta worldline ending (Kurisu stays dead, bittersweet not happy), add more Mayuri death variations, Okabe doesn't recover fully
- If player wants MORE romance: Expand Okabe/Kurisu relationship scenes, add other romance routes (Mayuri, Faris, Luka arcs), slice-of-life dating moments

## Usage Notes

### When to Use This Profile

**Perfect for**:
- Players who love **time-travel narratives** (loops, paradoxes, timeline mechanics)
- Campaigns focused on **psychological horror** (isolation, repetition, inevitability, identity)
- Groups interested in **hard sci-fi** (physics-based magic system, real-world tech extrapolation)
- Stories about **sacrifice and impossible choices** (trolley problems, save one vs many, determinism vs free will)
- Mystery-heavy plots (conspiracy investigation, clue-gathering, reveals)
- **Slow-burn character drama** (first half bonding, second half suffering pays off)

**NOT ideal for**:
- Action-focused groups (minimal combat, "battles" are intellectual/emotional)
- Fast-paced campaigns (requires slow setup for emotional payoff)
- Players who dislike technobabble (heavy exposition, physics discussions)
- Groups wanting pure comedy or lighthearted tone (second half is BRUTAL)
- Players uncomfortable with repetition (time loops, seeing same events differently)

### Calibration Tips

1. **Time Loop Design**: If using loops, track what CHANGES each iteration (butterfly effects, player learning, NPC variations). Make convergence REAL - certain events inevitable, method varies. Let player feel futility before revealing loophole.

2. **Reading Steiner Equivalent**: Give ONE player "observer" status (remembers loops, others don't). Isolate them narratively - no one believes their warnings, they carry trauma alone. Make it CURSE not power.

3. **Technobabble Balance**: Explain mechanics thoroughly (time travel rules, divergence %, convergence) but allow player to not fully grasp - Okabe doesn't understand everything either. Emotional stakes > perfect comprehension.

4. **Sacrifice Dilemmas**: Present trolley problems with NO good answer. If player saves A, B suffers. If player undoes action, C loses happiness. Track accumulating consequences - make undoing painful (convince NPC to give up wish they cherished).

5. **Tone Shift Pacing**: Start LIGHT (establish normalcy, bonds, humor). Then BREAK it (major character death, betrayal, revelation). Don't return to full comedy - allow gallows humor but maintain weight.

6. **Mystery Layering**: Seed clues early (SERN mentions, strange messages, NPC inconsistencies). Make first-time players miss them, rewatchers (or loop-aware PCs) notice. Foreshadow everything, reveal systematically.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **WRONG**: Time travel is easy, spam D-mails without consequence  
✅ **RIGHT**: Every alteration has BUTTERFLY EFFECT (intended change + unintended ripples), convergence limits changes, mechanics have costs (17 neurons die per time-leap)

❌ **WRONG**: Player can save everyone effortlessly  
✅ **RIGHT**: Trolley problem is REAL - alpha saves Mayuri (Kurisu dies, SERN dystopia), beta saves Kurisu (Mayuri dies, WW3), Steins Gate saves both BUT requires perfect execution + luck + suffering first

❌ **WRONG**: Time loops are boring repetition  
✅ **RIGHT**: Each loop shows NEW perspective (NPC had hidden motive, detail missed before, slight variation leads to different death method), player LEARNS from failures

❌ **WRONG**: Other characters remember loops  
✅ **RIGHT**: ONLY observer-equivalent PC remembers (Reading Steiner), everyone else has memories overwritten, isolation is KEY to horror

❌ **WRONG**: Chunibyo is just comedy quirk  
✅ **RIGHT**: Okabe's mad scientist persona is COPING MECHANISM (shields from trauma), DROPS when he breaks (ep 22: no Hououin Kyouma, just broken Okabe), RETURNS when he heals (sign of recovery)

❌ **WRONG**: Explain time travel vaguely ("it's magic")  
✅ **RIGHT**: Establish RULES (D-mail limits, worldline theory, convergence, divergence %), respect those rules religiously, make player understand mechanics so they can theorize solutions

❌ **WRONG**: Rushed pacing (get to time loops immediately)  
✅ **RIGHT**: INVEST in characters first (slice-of-life bonding, lab family dynamics, establish normal) so when horror hits, it HURTS. Mayuri's death only matters if we love her first.

## Genre Trope Library References

**Primary Genre Libraries**:
- `scifi_tropes.md` - **Hard Sci-Fi** (worldline theory, time travel paradoxes, causality mechanics, bootstrap loops, divergence measurement, scientific rigor, technological constraints, SERN conspiracy, IBN 5100 computer, attractor field convergence)
- `mystery_thriller_tropes.md` - **Time Loop Mystery** (investigation through repetition, clue gathering across timelines, deduction systems, conspiracy plots, red herrings via timeline changes, plot twists through perspective shifts, psychological manipulation, layered mysteries, cat-and-mouse with SERN)
- `seinen_tropes.md` - **Psychological Drama** (moral complexity, existential themes, character suffering, trolley problems, isolation psychology, trauma responses, mental deterioration, sacrifice dilemmas, mature themes, slow-burn tension)

**Secondary Genre Elements**:
- `slice_of_life_tropes.md` - First half character bonding (lab family dynamics, quirky daily routines, mundane moments that establish emotional stakes)
- `comedy_tropes.md` - Early episodes only (chunibyo persona as coping mechanism, otaku references, absurdist lab experiments, straight man/funny man dynamics that disappear after tonal shift)

**Integration Notes**: 
Steins;Gate exemplifies **genre shift** - starts slice-of-life comedy (eps 1-11) to build emotional investment, then pivots hard into psychological thriller/sci-fi horror (ep 12+). The comedy elements serve narrative purpose (make Mayuri's death shocking, establish Okabe's chunibyo as mask for trauma). Time travel mechanics follow hard sci-fi rules (worldline theory, convergence, divergence numbers) rather than soft fantasy. Mystery structure uses time loops for investigation (player learns from repeated failures, pieces together conspiracy). Seinen psychological depth in trolley problem (save Mayuri vs Kurisu), isolation horror (only Okabe remembers), mental deterioration from witnessing loved ones die repeatedly.

**Cross-Reference**: See `dandadan_profile.md` for contrasting approach (shonen comedy-action that maintains tone), `rezero_profile.md` for similar time loop psychology but isekai framing, `death_note_profile.md` for psychological thriller without time mechanics.
