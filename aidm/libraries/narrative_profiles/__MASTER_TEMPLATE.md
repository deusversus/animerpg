## Mechanical Scaffolding (AIDM Integration)

*This section maps narrative DNA to AIDM mechanics using the complete Module 12 framework (11-tier VS Battles system, 9 narrative scales, power imbalance detection with context modifiers).*

### Power Level Mapping (Module 12 Narrative Scaling)

**Narrative DNA**:
- **Power Fantasy Rating**: X/10 (from Scale 3) - [Justify: underdog/balanced/OP protagonist]
- **Threat Profile**: [Description of threat types and power dynamics relative to PCs]
- **Death Risk**: Low | Medium | High | MAXIMUM - [Description of lethality, plot armor presence/absence, permanent consequences]

**Maps To (Complete 11-Tier VS Battles Framework)**:
- **VS Battles Tier Range** (reference `power_tier_reference.md` for full definitions):
  - **Starting Tier**: T[XX] ([Tier Name]) - [Description of initial PC power level]
    - Example: T10-B (Human level) - Regular untrained civilian
    - Example: T9-C (Street level) - Enhanced martial artist, can crack concrete
    - Example: T5-B (Planetary level) - Can destroy/survive planet-scale attacks
  - **Mid-Campaign Tier**: T[XX] ([Tier Name]) - [Power level at sessions 15-25]
  - **Late-Campaign Tier**: T[XX] ([Tier Name]) - [Power level at sessions 30-50+]
  - **Force Projection** (if applicable): [When PC's personal tier ≠ commanded force tier, specify both]
    - Example: Lelouch personally T10-B, but commands T8-B Black Knights force
- **Growth Model**: Modest (slow T→T+1) | Accelerated (rapid T→T+3) | Instant OP (start high, no growth)
  - Justify based on source anime's power progression speed
- **Start Level**: L[X] (T[XX]) - [Why this starting power? Rookie vs veteran vs godlike]
- **Pivot Point**: Sessions [X-Y] (T[XX] → T[YY]) - [Major power-up moment, training arc, awakening]
- **End State**: L[X] (T[XX]) by sessions [Y-Z] - [Campaign endpoint power level]

**Narrative Scale Assignment (Module 12 Complete Framework)**:
- **Primary Scale**: [Scale Name] [[OK]/[!]/[NO]] for T[XX] range
  - [1-2 sentence description of why this scale fits the tier and narrative]
  - Reference Module 12's 9 scales: Tactical Survival, Strategic Combat, Ensemble Focus, Reverse Ensemble, Mythology Journey, Faction Building, Mythic Spectacle, Conceptual Philosophy, Metafictional
- **Secondary Scale** (if applicable): [Scale Name] [[OK]/[!]] for T[XX] context
  - [When/why this scale applies - different phase, specific arcs, optional mode]
- **Tertiary Scale** (if applicable): [Scale Name] for niche situations
- **Compatibility Matrix Check**: Reference Module 12 matrix - confirm assigned scales are [OK] or [!] for tier range, NOT [NO] or [X]

**Power Imbalance Detection** (Module 12 Section 3):
- **Formula**: Effective Imbalance = (PC Raw Tier ÷ Threat Raw Tier) × Context Modifiers
- **Raw Imbalance**: T[PC] ÷ T[Threat] = [X.X] ([extreme underdog 0.1 / balanced 1.0 / moderate advantage 3.0 / overwhelming 10.0+])
- **Context Modifiers** (Module 12 Section 3.1):
  - [Modifier Type]: ×[0.X] ([reason - environmental limits, secret identity, self-limiter, mentor role, political constraints, genre])
  - [If multiple, list each]: ×[0.X] ([reason])
  - [Example: Secret Identity ×0.3 (can't reveal godhood, maintains F-rank cover)]
  - [Example: Environmental ×0.1 (Frieza can't destroy planet he's standing on)]
- **Effective Imbalance**: [Raw] × [Mod1] × [Mod2] = **[X.XX]** ([interpretation])
- **Imbalance Trigger Actions** (Module 12 Section 3.2):
  - 0.5-1.5: Balanced → Stay in current scale (Tactical/Strategic)
  - 1.5-3.0: Moderate → Shift Tactical→Strategic or Strategic→Ensemble
  - 3.0-10.0: Significant → Ensemble or Spectacle recommended
  - 10.0+: Overwhelming → Spectacle/Concept/OP Mode required
  - [State which trigger applies and resulting scale choice]

**Tier-Appropriate Combat Narration** (Module 08 × Module 12 Integration):
- **Combat Language by Tier** (reference `skill_taxonomies.md` Tier-Appropriate Skill Narration):
  - **T11-T10 (Human)**: "strike, dodge, block, swing, parry" - [Example narration]
  - **T9 (Superhuman)**: "smash, shatter, leap, blur, crack" - [Example narration]
  - **T8 (Urban)**: "demolish, crater, pulverize, sonic-boom" - [Example narration]
  - **T7 (Nuclear)**: "vaporize, annihilate, earthquake, shockwave" - [Example narration]
  - [Continue up to campaign's max tier - T6/T5/T4 etc if applicable]
- **Narration Escalation Path**: [How language shifts as PCs tier up - quote examples from profile's combat scenes]

**Relevant Libraries**:
- `power_tier_reference.md` (narrative guidance for tier range, anime examples, campaign patterns)
- `vsbw_comprehensive_reference.md` (VS Battles calculations, tier definitions, energy values)
- `skill_taxonomies.md` (tier-appropriate skill narration, OP protagonist skill design)
- [power_system_file.md] (if exists - specific to anime's magic/tech/mutation system)
- [combat_system_file.md] (if exists - specific subsystems like ODM gear, Knightmare Frames, etc.)

**Genre Tropes Applied**: 
- [List specific trope files matching anime genre - shonen/seinen/isekai/mecha/etc.]
- Reference Module 13 (Narrative Calibration) for genre-specific guidance

**Reasoning**: [2-3 sentences justifying tier assignments, growth model choice, narrative scale selection, and how power imbalance detection informs gameplay. Compare/contrast with other anime profiles to show positioning.]
