## Storytelling Tropes (ON/OFF)

**ENABLED**:
- ✅ **Tragic Backstory**: Every character haunted (Eren's mother, Reiner's identity crisis)
- ✅ **Escalating Threats**: Titans → Titan Shifters → Marley → Global War
- ✅ **Existential Philosophy**: Freedom, hatred, cycle of violence, genocide morality
- ✅ **Mystery Box**: Basement reveal, Ymir's backstory, Founder's power
- ✅ **Inner Monologue**: Eren's rage, Reiner's dissociation, Erwin's doubt
- ✅ **Tragic Hero**: Eren's fall from hero to anti-hero/villain

**DISABLED**:
- ❌ Fourth Wall Breaks: Never
- ❌ Rapid Tonal Shifts: Sustained grim tone (comedy rare, fleeting)
- ❌ Power of Friendship: Bonds matter but don't override grim reality
- ❌ Rule of Cool: Logic and consequence matter (characters die permanently)
- ❌ Tournament Arcs: War, not sport
- ❌ Awkward Comedy: No romantic comedy beats
- ❌ Slice-of-Life: Every peaceful moment is temporary, threatened

## Example Scenes

### Combat Example (Battle of Trost District)

```
The Colossal Titan's head looms over Wall Rose. Steam billows from exposed muscle.

Eren (internal): *Mother died to a Titan. Hannes died. Everyone I care about—always Titans. No more.*

"All squads!" Commander Pixis barks through megaphone. "Execute the sealing operation! Failure means extinction!"

Soldiers launch ODM gears—cables firing into buildings, gas propelling bodies through air. Formation: diversionary squads draw Titans away from Eren's approach.

A 10-meter Titan lunges at Jean's squad. Connie slices nape—blood spray, body collapses. No celebration. Three more Titans converging.

"Casualties mounting!" Jean reports via signal flare. "We can't hold much longer!"

Eren transforms—lightning strike, ground CRACKS, 15-meter Attack Titan emerges. He lifts boulder (massive, impossible weight). Muscles strain. Every step toward gate = Titans attracted.

Mikasa (protecting Eren's flank): "I won't let them touch you." Blades flash—two Titans down in seconds. Her gas gauge: 40%. Rationing required.

Eren reaches gate. Plants boulder. Seals breach. 

Victory? No. Casualty report: 207 soldiers dead. 19 missing. For one sealed gate.

Pixis (quiet, to Erwin): "We won. But at this rate... how many gates can we seal before we run out of soldiers?"

Erwin stares at Wall Maria in distance. "Not enough."

What do you do?
```

**Key Techniques**: Grim stakes (extinction threat), military tactics (formations, diversions), constant death toll, pyrrhic victory, no triumphant celebration, resource management (gas, blades), existential weight, formal military communication.

### Dialogue Example (Erwin's Gamble)

```
Erwin stands before the Survey Corps. Behind him: certain death. Ahead: possible hope.

"Recruits." His voice carries weight. "In a moment, I will ask you to ride to your deaths."

Silence. Fear palpable.

"The Cart Titan and Beast Titan wait beyond this wall. Our weapons are useless against the Beast's range. He will slaughter us before we reach him."

Floch (trembling): "Then... why charge?"

Erwin meets his eyes. "Because while he massacres us, Captain Levi will flank from cover. He alone can kill the Beast Titan."

Jean: "You're asking us to be *bait*."

"I'm asking you to give meaning to your deaths." Erwin's hand hovers over his heart. "To entrust the future of humanity to those who survive. This is the reality of our war."

Marlowe (young, idealistic): "Is there no other way?"

"There is." Erwin's voice drops. "We surrender. Return to the walls. Live a few more years before Marley destroys us anyway."

He raises his arm. "Or we charge. Die now. But give humanity a chance."

The weight settles. This isn't heroic. This is calculated sacrifice.

Connie's voice cracks: "Will it matter? Will anyone remember?"

Erwin: "No. History won't record your names. But the future—if we win—will exist because of you."

"SHINZOU WO SASAGEYO!" The cry starts small. Spreads. Becomes roar.

Not triumph. *Acceptance of death*.

Erwin leads charge. Knows he won't survive. Doesn't matter.

What do you do?
```

**Key Techniques**: Brutal honesty (no false hope), military formality ("recruits," "Captain"), philosophical weight (meaning of death), calculated sacrifice, no power-of-friendship rescue, accepting futility yet charging anyway, formal address, existential choice.

### Exploration Example (Discovering Basement Truth)

```
The basement door creaks open. Dust billows—untouched for five years since Shiganshina fell.

Eren's hands shake as he lifts the kerosene lamp. "Everything... answers are here."

Mikasa (beside him, protective): "We don't have to—"

"We do." Eren descends stairs. Each step CREAKS. Weight of entire journey pressing down.

Basement room: small, ordinary. Desk. Bookshelf. Locked drawer.

Levi examines drawer. "Locked. Eren, the key."

Eren produces basement key—the one his father entrusted before disappearing. Hands shaking. *What if the truth is worse than the mystery?*

Key turns. Click. Drawer opens.

Inside: Three photograph daguerreotypes. Impossible. Photography doesn't exist within walls.

First photo: Man resembling Grisha Yeager in strange clothes (modern suit?). Behind him: *buildings taller than Wall Maria*. Impossible. No structure that large exists.

Second photo: Family portrait. Grisha younger. Woman (wife?). Child. All smiling. Behind them: city skyline. Advanced. Beyond Survey Corps' technology.

Third photo: Grisha with group of people. Banner behind them (different language): "Eldian Restorationists."

Armin (analytical): "These buildings... this technology... they exist *outside* the walls. Humanity didn't fall. We were *caged*."

Beneath photos: journal. Grisha's handwriting. Eren opens to first page:

*"To whoever finds this: The history you were taught is a lie. We Eldians are not the last humans. We are prisoners. And the world beyond these walls... despises us."*

The truth crystallizes: Paradis Island is a prison. Marley is the jailer. The Titans... weapons in a 2,000-year war.

Eren's hands tighten on journal. "They caged us. Made us fight Titans. For what?"

He keeps reading. Learns: Ymir Fritz. The Founder. Eldian Empire's atrocities. Marley's retaliation. King Fritz's guilty exile to Paradis.

Every page makes it worse.

The walls weren't protection. They were a *cage* keeping monsters (them) contained.

Eren closes journal. Voice hollow: "We're not the victims. We're the descendants of oppressors."

Mikasa: "Eren—"

"And the world wants us dead for sins committed 2,000 years ago."

Silence.

This truth doesn't set them free. It makes everything worse.

What do you do?
```

**Key Techniques**: Slow revelation (building dread), ordinary setting (basement mundane, truth cosmic), visual proof (photos), journal exposition, truth worse than mystery, no triumphant discovery, moral complexity (Eldians are both victims and inheritors of atrocity), crushing weight, philosophical despair.

## Usage Notes

**Apply This Profile When**:
- Player requests Attack on Titan-inspired campaign
- Session Zero selected "grim dark survival horror with military tactics"
- Player wants "brutal stakes, character death, moral complexity"

**Calibration Tips**:
- **NO SAFETY**: Every peaceful moment is temporary—threat always looming
- **DEATH IS PERMANENT**: Characters die. No resurrection. Grief lingers.
- **FORMAL TONE**: Military structure (salutes, ranks, "dedicate your hearts")
- **PYRRHIC VICTORIES**: Wins cost enormously (seal one gate, lose 200 soldiers)
- **MORAL GREY**: No pure heroes/villains (Eren becomes antagonist, Reiner sympathetic)
- **PHILOSOPHY INTEGRATED**: Freedom, hatred, cycle of violence as core themes

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- ❌ Comic relief undercutting tension (Sasha/Connie moments are RARE)
- ❌ Plot armor (main characters can and do die)
- ❌ Easy victories (every win is costly, temporary)
- ❌ Casual dialogue (maintain military formality)
- ❌ Power fantasy (protagonists always outmatched)
- ❌ Optimistic outcomes (endings are bittersweet at best)
