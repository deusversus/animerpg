## Narrative Scales (0-10)

**Scale 0: Introspection vs Action** = **3/10 (ACTION-LEANING with Emotional Beats)**

DanDaDan prioritizes **HIGH-ENERGY ACTION (70%) with PUNCTUATED introspection (30%)**—characters ACT first, reflect BRIEFLY between chaos (Episode 1: Momo + Okarun argument → immediate alien/ghost attack, 2 minutes talking → 18 minutes supernatural mayhem). Action = CONSTANT: fight sequences 8-12 minutes per episode (alien battles, yokai encounters, body-horror transformations, Science SARU animation showcases MOVEMENT—running, dodging, psychic powers exploding, rarely static). BUT introspection EXISTS via CHARACTER MOMENTS: Episode 3 Okarun's transformation anxiety (2-minute internal monologue: "I'm turning into monster, losing myself, what if I can't turn back?"—fear VOCALIZED briefly, then BACK to fighting Turbo Granny), Episode 5 Momo's grandmother memories (90-second flashback while fighting, emotional context FOR action not separate FROM it). Introspection = INTEGRATED not separate: characters think WHILE fighting (Episode 7 Okarun mid-battle: "She's counting on me. Can't let her down." → powers up, action CONTINUES—thought fuels action, doesn't pause it). Contrast Attack on Titan (5/10 balanced—action sequences + long political debates), Mushishi (9/10 contemplative—entire episodes philosophy/observation)—DanDaDan = 3/10 minimal introspection, action/comedy DOMINATES, reflection = seasoning not main dish.

**AIDM Guidance**: **Action = 70% sessions** (Session 5: 2.5 hours combat/chases/supernatural encounters, 1 hour character dialogue, movement constant). **Introspection = BRIEF BEATS** (Session 10 PC has emotional moment, DM: "You get 5 minutes. Process fear of transformation. Then yokai attacks AGAIN, back to action."—can't dwell, must MOVE). **Thought during action** (Session 15 mid-combat, player rolls attack, DM: "Before you strike, what's PC thinking? Quick sentence, then EXECUTE."—internal monologue FLAVORS action, doesn't stop it). **NO long philosophy sessions** (Session 20 player: "Can we have 2-hour debate about meaning of powers?"—DM: "No. This is action-comedy genre. 15 minutes character talk MAX, then alien invasion. Keep moving."). Session Zero: "This is 70% action/comedy—chases, fights, supernatural chaos constant. Introspection = 30%, brief emotional beats between mayhem. Comfortable with MINIMAL contemplation, HIGH kinetic energy, constant movement?"

---

**Scale 1: Comedy vs Drama** = **4/10 (COMEDY-LEANING but Dramatic Stakes)**

DanDaDan is **COMEDY-DOMINANT (60%) with REAL dramatic weight (40%)**—tonal WHIPLASH rapid (30 seconds absurd comedy → 2 minutes genuine horror/romance, REPEAT). Comedy = CONSTANT: banter EVERY scene (Momo: "You're useless!" Okarun: "I'm TRYING!"—Episode 1-12 dynamic, verbal sparring never stops), visual gags frequent (Episode 2: Okarun's naked transformation = played for laughs, awkward comedy gold, body-horror + embarrassment combo), absurd situations (Episode 4: fighting crab-alien while arguing about romance, surreal tonal mix). BUT drama HITS: Episode 3 Turbo Granny possession (Okarun's fear GENUINE—"I'm losing control, becoming monster," 3 minutes horror-dread, zero jokes, Science SARU animation shifts DARK—shadows deepen, eyes glow red, atmospheric shift). Episode 6 Momo's isolation flashback: bullied for psychic powers (90 seconds PURE drama, no comedy undercut, establishes her pain, THEN back to action-comedy). Romance = DRAMATIC: Momo + Okarun's feelings REAL (Episode 8: Momo's blush when Okarun compliments her, 15 seconds GENUINE warmth, not joke—dramatic sincerity amid comedy chaos). Contrast Konosuba (2/10 pure comedy, drama minimal), Attack on Titan (8/10 heavy drama, rare levity)—DanDaDan = 4/10 comedy-leaning BUT stakes MATTER, deaths possible, emotions REAL, just wrapped in absurdist humor packaging.

**AIDM Guidance**: **Comedy = DEFAULT tone** (60% sessions, DM describes absurd situations—Session 5: "Alien wears business suit, speaks formal Japanese while tentacles flail. PC must fight AND navigate bizarre etiquette."—surreal humor). **Drama PUNCTUATES** (Session 10: 40 minutes comedy banter/action, final 20 minutes = NPC's tragic backstory revealed, tone SHIFTS dark, players must RESPECT moment, zero jokes). **Rapid tonal shifts** (Session 15: PC cracks joke mid-fight, next moment ally gets injured SERIOUSLY, DM: "Blood. Real stakes. Joke lands, but consequence IMMEDIATE."—whiplash intentional, keeps players OFF-BALANCE). **Romance = SINCERE** (Session 20 PC confesses feelings, DM: "This moment is REAL. No comedy undercut. NPC responds genuinely. 5 minutes dramatic sincerity, THEN back to chaos."—emotional beats EARNED). **Stakes MATTER** (Session 25 NPC can DIE, DM: "Comedy doesn't mean plot armor. Wrong choice = death. Stakes are REAL despite absurdist tone."). Session Zero: "60% comedy (absurd humor, banter, visual gags), 40% drama (real stakes, deaths possible, emotions genuine). Rapid tonal shifts—comedy → horror → romance → back in 5 minutes. Comfortable with whiplash pacing, mixing laughs + scares + feels constantly?"

---

**Scale 2: Simple vs Complex Narrative** = **5/10 (STRAIGHTFORWARD Plot, SURREAL Execution)**

DanDaDan's plot is **DECEPTIVELY simple** (aliens invade + ghosts haunt, protagonists fight them, underlying mysteries about Okarun's powers/Turbo Granny's origins, BUT execution = SURREAL CHAOS makes FEELS complex). Surface plot CLEAR: Episode 1-3 = retrieve Okarun's stolen "kintama" (balls) from Turbo Granny (goal explicit, stakes comedic-yet-serious), Episode 4-8 = fight escalating yokai/aliens (monster-of-the-week structure with building lore), overarching mystery = WHY aliens target Earth + Okarun's transformation mechanics (questions RAISED, answers SLOW). Complexity = TONAL not PLOT: fights blend comedy + horror + romance SIMULTANEOUSLY (Episode 7: battling crab-alien while Momo + Okarun have romantic tension argument, three genres LAYERED, creates PERCEPTUAL complexity despite simple "defeat monster" plot). World-building ACCUMULATES: Episode 5 introduces Acrobatic Silky (tragic yokai backstory, single mother's grief, 12-minute emotional arc WITHIN monster fight—thematic depth SUDDEN), Episode 9 alien hierarchy hinted (Serpoians have REASONS for harvesting humans, not explained YET—mystery box complexity). Contrast Hunter x Hunter (8/10 Nen system + political intrigue layers), Demon Slayer (4/10 simple demon-slaying, emotional but uncomplicated)—DanDaDan = 5/10 BALANCED, plot easy to follow (fight aliens/ghosts, protect each other) BUT tonal/thematic layering + surreal aesthetics create FELT complexity (viewer thinks "what AM I watching?" not because plot confusing, but because VIBES defy categorization).

**AIDM Guidance**: **Plot = STRAIGHTFORWARD** (Session 5 objective: "Defeat yokai terrorizing town, retrieve stolen item."—CLEAR goal, no political intrigue labyrinths). **Execution = SURREAL** (Session 5 SAME fight: yokai is tragic ghost-mother, battle has comedy (alien interference), horror (body transformation), romance (PCs bicker WHILE fighting)—DM juggles THREE TONES simultaneously, creates perceptual complexity). **Mystery boxes EXIST** (Session 10 introduce alien faction, DM: "They have GOAL, not just 'be evil.' What do they want? You don't know YET."—long-term questions raised, answers Sessions 20-30). **Monster-of-the-week STRUCTURE** (Sessions 1-20 = episodic threats, each session NEW yokai/alien, BUT backstories ACCUMULATE—Session 15 yokai connects to Session 8 lore, episodic becomes SERIALIZED subtly). **Emotional depth SUDDEN** (Session 18 seems simple "fight ghost," becomes 30-minute tragic backstory reveal—single mother's grief, players CRY, complexity via EMOTION not plot mechanics). Session Zero: "Plot is simple—fight supernatural threats, protect each other, uncover mysteries SLOWLY. But EXECUTION is surreal—comedy + horror + romance blended every session, tonal complexity creates 'what IS this?' energy. Comfortable with straightforward goals, chaotic vibes, emotional gut-punches amid absurdity?"

---

**Scale 3: Power Fantasy vs Struggle** = **6/10 (COMPETENT Protagonists, CHALLENGED Constantly)**

DanDaDan balances **CAPABLE heroes (Momo's psychic powers STRONG, Okarun's transformation POWERFUL) vs GENUINE threats (aliens/yokai DANGEROUS, victories EARNED not given)**. Momo = COMPETENT: Episode 1 awakens psychic powers (telekinesis IMMEDIATE, throws alien across room, learns fast, NOT helpless damsel), Episode 5 vs Acrobatic Silky (holds own 8 minutes, strategic power use—throws debris, creates barriers, SKILLED but not OP). Okarun = POWER with COST: transformation grants speed + strength (Episode 3: blitzes Turbo Granny, fast enough to dodge bullets), BUT loses control (berserker rage, hurts allies, Episode 4: nearly attacks Momo, power = DOUBLE-EDGED). Struggle = REAL: Episode 7 crab-alien fight (Momo + Okarun TEAMWORK required, solo = death, barely survive, exhausted after, victory HARD-WON). Episode 9 Serpoian encounter: LOSE initial fight (aliens retreat strategically, protagonists OUTMATCHED, rare shonen "heroes lose" honesty). Growth = GRADUAL: Momo's powers strengthen Episodes 1 → 12 (telekinetic weight increases, precision improves, TRAINING shown not just "level up"), Okarun learns control (Episode 10: maintains transformation longer, doesn't rage-out, progress VISIBLE). Contrast Overlord (2/10 Ainz OP always, zero struggle), My Hero Academia (7/10 Deku grows from weak → strong, LONG journey)—DanDaDan = 6/10 protagonists START capable (not helpless), but enemies CHALLENGE them (teamwork required, losses possible, growth = refinement not zero-to-hero).

**AIDM Guidance**: **PCs = COMPETENT from Session 1** (character creation, DM: "You START with powers—psychic abilities OR transformation. Not 'normal teen becomes hero,' you're ALREADY capable. But enemies match you."—avoid helpless opening). **Enemies = DANGEROUS** (Session 5 yokai, DM: "This ghost can KILL you. Teamwork mandatory. Solo = death. Respect threat."—no "mook enemies," every fight STAKES). **Powers have COSTS** (Session 10 PC uses transformation, DM: "You go berserk. Roll Wisdom save DC 15 or attack nearest ally. Power = risk."—double-edged mechanics). **Growth = REFINEMENT** (Sessions 1-20, PC's psychic power weight increases 50 lbs → 500 lbs, precision improves, TRAINING shown—not sudden "unlock level 5," gradual skill-up). **Losses ALLOWED** (Session 15 villain retreats strategically, DM: "You're outmatched. They ESCAPE. You didn't win. Frustrating? Yes. Realistic? Also yes."—not every fight = victory). Session Zero: "PCs are COMPETENT—start with powers, not powerless. But enemies are DANGEROUS—teamwork required, losses possible, victories EARNED. Growth = refining skills over 20 sessions, not zero-to-hero instant power-up. Comfortable with capable heroes who still struggle, powers with costs, occasional defeats?"

---

**Scale 4: Explained vs Mysterious** = **7/10 (HIGH Mystery—Lore Revealed SLOWLY)**

DanDaDan **RAISES questions CONSTANTLY, answers GRADUALLY**—mysteries LINGER Episodes 1-12+ (Turbo Granny's true nature? Serpoian alien goals? Okarun's "kintama" significance beyond comedy? Momo's grandmother's past?). Episode 1 establishes MYSTERIES: aliens abduct humans (WHY? Scientific experiment? Harvest organs? NOT explained immediately), Turbo Granny curses Okarun (backstory? Motivations? Episodes 1-10 = UNKNOWN). Partial reveals: Episode 3 Turbo Granny backstory HINTED (protects girls from predators, tragic past implied, NOT full explanation—teases depth, withholds details), Episode 9 Serpoian hierarchy (they SERVE higher power, goals unclear, mystery DEEPENS not resolves). Powers = SHOWN not explained: Momo's psychic abilities WORK (telekinesis, barriers, exorcism), but HOW? Episode 1-12 = zero exposition ("psychic powers exist, some people have them, Momo's grandmother taught basics"—mechanics VAGUE). Okarun's transformation: cursed by Turbo Granny, gains speed/strength, LOSE "kintama" (plot device), recovery quest = excuse for adventures, BUT transformation MECHANICS unexplained (why speed specifically? How does curse WORK? Mysteries REMAIN). Contrast Hunter x Hunter (5/10 Nen explained extensively, 20 episodes), Death Note (5/10 rules CLEAR, mysteries = character plans)—DanDaDan = 7/10 HIGH mystery, lore drip-fed SLOWLY, audience DOESN'T know how world works Episodes 1-12, speculation ENCOURAGED (intentional mystery-box storytelling, answers come Season 2+).

**AIDM Guidance**: **Mysteries = DELIBERATE** (Session 1 introduce aliens, DM: "They abduct humans. WHY? You don't know. Won't know Session 5. MAYBE Session 20."—long-term questions, patience required). **Partial reveals** (Session 10 villain backstory HINTED, DM: "Flashback shows tragic past... 30 seconds. Then cuts back. You know SOME, not ALL. Frustrating? Intentional."—teases depth, withholds completion). **Powers = FUNCTIONAL not explained** (Session 5 PC uses psychic barrier, player: "How does it work?"—DM: "It WORKS. You concentrate, barrier appears. Mechanics? Unknown. Mystery."—show don't tell, avoid exposition dumps). **World-building ACCUMULATES** (Session 15 NPC mentions "Serpoian Council," Session 20 Council appears briefly, Session 30 Council's role EXPLAINED—slow lore drip across 30 sessions, not info-dump Session 1). **Players SPECULATE** (Session 12 DM encourages: "What do YOU think aliens want? Theories?"—speculation = gameplay, mysteries fuel engagement). Session Zero: "This is MYSTERY-BOX storytelling—questions raised Session 1, answers come Session 20-40. Powers WORK but mechanics unexplained. Lore revealed SLOWLY across long campaign. Comfortable with NOT knowing how world operates, trusting answers EVENTUALLY come, enjoying speculation?"

---

**Scale 5: Fast-Paced vs Slow Burn** = **2/10 (HYPER-FAST—Constant Escalation)**

DanDaDan is **RELENTLESSLY FAST**—Episode 1 introduces aliens + ghosts + romance + body horror in 24 minutes (zero slow introduction, IMMEDIATE chaos), pacing = BREAKNECK across 12 episodes (fight → brief dialogue → NEXT fight, minimal downtime, Science SARU animation MOVES constantly). Episode structure: 2 minutes dialogue setup → 8 minutes action → 3 minutes character beat → 10 minutes climax fight → 1 minute cliffhanger (RAPID scene turnover, no 10-minute campfire philosophy sessions). Action sequences = UNBROKEN: Episode 5 Acrobatic Silky fight (12 minutes continuous animation, camera NEVER stops moving, characters run/dodge/attack fluidly, exhausting to WATCH, intentional kinetic overload). Dialogue = SNAPPY: conversations 30 seconds-2 minutes MAX (Momo: "We need plan!"—Okarun: "No time!"—alien attacks 10 seconds later, talking INTERRUPTED by action constantly). Romance = FAST DEVELOPMENT: Momo + Okarun meet Episode 1, psychic bond Episode 2, mutual crush CLEAR Episode 5 (contrast typical romance anime's 24-episode slow-burn, DanDaDan = 5 episodes = feelings OBVIOUS). Contrast Vinland Saga S2 (8/10 slow burn, 24 episodes farming), Mushishi (9/10 contemplative pacing, 24 minutes = single yokai encounter meditation)—DanDaDan = 2/10 FASTEST anime pacing, ZERO patience, momentum NEVER stops, designed for Gen Z attention spans (TikTok-era storytelling, rapid dopamine hits).

**AIDM Guidance**: **Sessions = CONSTANT MOVEMENT** (Session 5: 15 minutes = 3 scenes—dialogue, chase, fight climax, NO lingering, DM keeps clock MOVING). **Action = UNBROKEN** (Session 10 combat, DM: "12 minutes real-time, continuous narration. Describe EVERY action, no pauses, camera NEVER stops. Exhausting? YES. Intentional."—kinetic overload mirroring anime). **Dialogue = INTERRUPTED** (Session 15 PCs plan strategy, 90 seconds talking, DM: "Mid-sentence, door EXPLODES. Alien attack. Plan UNFINISHED, improvise NOW."—action cuts off talking constantly). **NO slow sessions** (Session 20 player: "Can we have chill shopping episode?"—DM: "30 seconds shopping, then yokai attacks store. No 'downtime episodes,' always MOVING."—relentless pacing). **Romance = FAST** (Sessions 1-5 = meet → bond → mutual feelings CLEAR, not 20-session will-they-won't-they, FAST relationship development). Session Zero: "This is HYPER-FAST pacing—constant action, minimal downtime, scenes 2 minutes max, talking interrupted by fights, momentum NEVER stops. Exhausting? YES. Gen Z energy. Comfortable with relentless speed, zero patience, rapid scene turnover every session?"

---

**Scale 6: Episodic vs Serialized** = **6/10 (ARC-BASED with Building Threads)**

DanDaDan uses **HYBRID structure**—individual arcs 2-4 episodes (Turbo Granny arc Episodes 1-3, Acrobatic Silky arc Episodes 4-6, Serpoian invasion arc Episodes 7-10), BUT overarching plot threads BUILD (Okarun's "kintama" recovery quest, Momo + Okarun's romance, alien conspiracy, grandmother's secrets = SERIALIZED across 12+ episodes). Episodic FEELING: Episodes 4-6 = self-contained Acrobatic Silky story (introduce yokai, tragic backstory, defeat her, arc COMPLETES—can watch standalone, emotional closure), Episode 7 = NEW threat (crab-alien, different conflict). BUT serialized CONNECTIVE TISSUE: Acrobatic Silky's defeat strengthens Momo (power growth CARRIES to Episode 7), romance subplot PROGRESSES each arc (Episode 3 Momo saves Okarun, Episode 6 Okarun saves Momo, reciprocal trust BUILDS), "kintama" quest = throughline (Episodes 1-12 ongoing, not resolved, SERIALIZED goal). Contrast Cowboy Bebop (3/10 mostly episodic, Spike's past 5 episodes only), Vinland Saga (9/10 hyper-serialized, 48-episode single arc)—DanDaDan = 6/10 BALANCED, can enjoy individual 3-episode arcs (newcomer-friendly), BUT full experience requires watching 1-12 (character growth, romance, mysteries = serialized rewards).

**AIDM Guidance**: **Arcs = 6-10 sessions** (Sessions 1-8 = Turbo Granny campaign arc, self-contained story, emotional climax Session 8, CAN end campaign there). **Throughlines = SERIALIZED** (Sessions 1-30 = overarching "kintama" quest, romance subplot, alien conspiracy—long-term plots UNDERNEATH episodic arcs). **Newcomer-friendly arcs** (Session 10 new player joins, DM: "Recap last arc 5 minutes, THIS arc starts fresh—new yokai, self-contained. But ongoing romance/mysteries continue."—episodic ENTRY points, serialized DEPTH for veterans). **Character growth CARRIES** (Session 8 PC defeats yokai, gains power-up, Session 10 USES that power vs new threat—progress SERIALIZED, not reset each arc). Session Zero: "Hybrid structure—6-10 session arcs (self-contained yokai/alien stories, emotional closure each arc), BUT overarching plots build (romance, mysteries, power growth across 30+ sessions). Can enjoy individual arcs standalone, FULL experience requires long-term play. Comfortable with episodic arcs + serialized throughlines?"

---

**Scale 7: Grounded vs Absurd** = **9/10 (PEAK Absurdity—Aliens + Ghosts + Body Horror Chaos)**

DanDaDan is **HYPER-ABSURD**—aliens wear business suits and speak formal Japanese while tentacles flail (Episode 4: Serpoian alien discusses "biological sampling protocols" in corporate jargon, surreal tonal clash), ghosts have BIZARRE rules (Turbo Granny = 100 km/h speed demon granny-ghost, tunnel-bound, steals genitals—WHY? Because absurd), body horror played for comedy AND horror (Episode 2: Okarun transforms, penis DETACHES and becomes sentient plot device, disturbing + hilarious simultaneously). Science SARU animation = SURREAL: perspective shifts EXTREME (fish-eye lens close-ups, impossible camera angles, Episode 6 Acrobatic Silky's ballet = physics-defying grace, beautiful but UNREAL), color palettes SHIFT (normal world = muted, supernatural = neon-saturated, tonal separation VISUAL). Logic = DREAM-LOGIC: aliens want "human reproductive organs for research" (vague sci-fi excuse, not hard SF explanation), ghosts = folklore + absurdist twist (Turbo Granny = urban legend + body-horror yokai, traditional + weird). Contrast Vinland Saga (2/10 grounded historical realism), Mushishi (7/10 fantastical mushi, grounded human reactions)—DanDaDan = 9/10 PEAK absurdism, tonal genre-blending (horror + comedy + romance + sci-fi + folklore SIMULTANEOUSLY), surrealist aesthetics, "what AM I watching?" intentional viewer response.

**AIDM Guidance**: **Embrace ABSURDITY** (Session 5 alien antagonist, DM: "He wears three-piece suit, tentacles emerge from briefcase, speaks corporate lingo: 'Pursuant to intergalactic harvesting protocols...' Serious tone, ABSURD content."—surreal juxtaposition). **Dream-logic ALLOWED** (Session 10 yokai rules, player: "Why does ghost need PERMISSION to enter?"—DM: "Folklore logic. Doesn't make sense scientifically, but THEMATIC. Accept dream-rules."—not hard magic system, vibes-based). **Body horror + comedy** (Session 15 PC transforms, DM: "Your arm DETACHES, grows teeth, attacks independently. Horrifying? Yes. Also played for laughs—NPC screams 'What the HELL?!' comedically. Both tones VALID."—horror + humor simultaneous). **Visual SURREALISM** (Session 20 climax fight, DM describes: "Camera spins 360°, impossible angle, colors SHIFT neon-pink, PC moves physics-defying—anime logic, not realism."—encourage absurdist descriptions). Session Zero: "This is 9/10 ABSURD—aliens in suits, ghosts steal genitals, body horror + comedy, dream-logic rules, surrealist aesthetics. NOT grounded realism. Comfortable with 'what IS this?' energy, tonal chaos, absurdism AS genre?"

---

**Scale 8: Tactical vs Instinctive** = **5/10 (ADAPTIVE Combat—Some Planning, Mostly Reactive)**

DanDaDan combat is **BALANCED improvisation**—characters PLAN briefly (30 seconds strategy discussion, "You distract, I'll flank!"), then CHAOS erupts and they ADAPT (plans fall apart 10 seconds in, improvise frantically, Episode 7 crab-alien: Momo's telekinesis plan fails when alien SPLITS into multiple crabs, panic-improvise new strategy mid-fight). Momo = TACTICAL MOMENTS: Episode 5 vs Acrobatic Silky (analyzes yokai's movement pattern, times telekinetic throw to intercept, 15 seconds THOUGHT then execution, SOME strategy), Episode 9 Serpoian fight (creates barriers strategically, funnels enemy movement, spatial awareness). Okarun = INSTINCTIVE BERSERKER: transformation = RAGE mode (Episode 3: charges blindly, speed compensates for zero planning, wins via overwhelming force not tactics), Episode 10 learns SOME control (aims punches deliberately, not just flailing, growth = instinct → refined instinct, not full tactical mastery). Teamwork = REACTIVE SYNERGY: Momo + Okarun DON'T pre-plan combos (no "Use Attack Pattern Delta-7!"), they READ each other mid-fight (Episode 8: Okarun distracts, Momo capitalizes INSTINCTIVELY, unspoken coordination, chemistry not chess). Contrast Hunter x Hunter (9/10 16-step Gon plans, tactical masterclass), Demon Slayer (3/10 Tanjiro improvises emotionally)—DanDaDan = 5/10 MIDDLE, brief tactical moments + mostly chaotic adaptation, plans exist but FLEXIBLE, combat = jazz improvisation not orchestrated symphony.

**AIDM Guidance**: **Brief planning ALLOWED** (Session 10 before fight, players get 60 seconds real-time: "Discuss strategy, GO."—short tactical window, then EXECUTE). **Plans FAIL** (Session 10 players' strategy, DM: "Enemy DOESN'T do what you expected. Plan invalid. Improvise NOW."—chaos forces adaptation, punishes over-planning). **Instinctive combos** (Session 15 two PCs, DM: "You SEE opening—PC 1's distraction creates gap. PC 2, you REACT. What do you do? 5 seconds decide."—snap decisions, not pre-planned choreography). **Growth = refined instinct** (Sessions 1-20, PC's berserker rage becomes AIMED berserker rage—still instinctive, but SMARTER instinct, not full tactical conversion). Session Zero: "Combat is 50% instinct, 50% brief tactics—plan 60 seconds, then chaos, adapt frantically. Teamwork = reactive synergy (read each other, improvise combos), not pre-planned choreography. Comfortable with jazz-improv combat, plans failing, snap decisions under pressure?"

---

**Scale 9: Hopeful vs Cynical** = **3/10 (OPTIMISTIC—Protagonists Persevere, World Salvageable)**

DanDaDan is **FUNDAMENTALLY HOPEFUL** despite horror/chaos—protagonists WON'T give up (Momo's determination UNBREAKABLE, Episode 5: "I'll NEVER abandon you!" to Okarun, shonen-esque resolve), world CAN be saved (aliens/yokai DEFEATABLE, not grimdark "humanity doomed" despair), found family FORMS (Momo + Okarun's bond STRENGTHENS each episode, Episode 10: mutual trust absolute, optimistic relationship growth). Even TRAGIC yokai get redemption: Acrobatic Silky Episode 6 (tragic backstory = single mother's grief, BUT Momo's compassion SAVES her spirit, peaceful passing, bittersweet HOPE not cynical cruelty). Aliens = EVIL but DEFEATABLE: Serpoians are antagonists (harvest humans, morally wrong), BUT protagonists CAN fight back (Episode 9: initial loss, BUT regroup, WILL try again, persistent optimism). Romance = SINCERE HOPE: Momo + Okarun's feelings GENUINE (zero cynical "relationships doomed" messaging, Episode 8 mutual blush = THEY'LL GET TOGETHER, optimistic slow-burn, not tragic star-crossed despair). Contrast Attack on Titan (7/10 cynical—world cruel, hope fragile), Vinland Saga (6/10 balanced—cynical world, stubborn hope)—DanDaDan = 3/10 HOPEFUL, Gen Z optimism (despite chaos, protagonists CHOOSE hope, fight for better world, bonds MATTER, love WINS eventually, shonen-adjacent positivity wrapped in horror-comedy aesthetics).

**AIDM Guidance**: **Protagonists = UNBREAKABLE** (Session 15 PC faces despair, DM: "You're beaten. Exhausted. But you DON'T give up. Inner voice: 'I can't abandon them.' Rally? YES. Shonen resolve."—optimistic determination CORE). **World = SALVAGEABLE** (Session 20 alien invasion, DM: "Threat is REAL. But defeatable. You CAN win. Not grimdark doomed, actionable hope."—avoid cynical fatalism). **Tragic NPCs get redemption** (Session 18 villain backstory reveals pain, PC shows compassion, DM: "Your kindness reaches them. Peaceful passing. Bittersweet but HOPEFUL."—redemption possible). **Romance = SINCERE** (Sessions 1-30 slow-burn, DM: "Feelings are REAL. They WILL get together eventually. Not tragic denial, optimistic inevitability."—hope for love). Session Zero: "This is 3/10 HOPEFUL—protagonists persevere, world salvageable, bonds matter, love wins, even tragic characters get redemption. NOT cynical grimdark. Comfortable with shonen-adjacent optimism, persistent hope despite chaos, Gen Z 'we'll fix this' energy?"

**Scale 11: Narrative Focus (Ensemble vs Solo)** = **7/10 DUAL PROTAGONISTS (Momo + Okarun Balanced Spotlight)**

DanDaDan is **TRUE DUO narrative**—Momo Ayase + Okarun (Ken Takakura) share spotlight EQUALLY (~45% each), supporting cast gets ~10% collective, dual-protagonist structure MAINTAINED across 12 episodes (not solo hero with sidekick, BOTH are leads with equal agency/development/screen-time).

**POV Distribution**:
- **Momo Ayase: ~45%** (psychic gyaru, present ALL major scenes, Episode 1 establishes HER world first—school, grandmother, psychic awakening, camera follows HER perspective meeting Okarun, Episodes 4-6 Acrobatic Silky arc = MOMO'S emotional journey primarily—her compassion saves yokai, growth moments HER focus, action scenes = equal participation but character beats MOMO-centric those episodes)
- **Okarun (Ken Takakura): ~45%** (occult-nerd, Episodes 1-3 transformation arc = OKARUN'S fear/identity crisis focus, "losing myself to curse" internal struggle HIS, Episode 7-9 = Okarun's determination moments, learning transformation control HIS arc, fights = equal BUT character development alternates spotlight—Momo Episodes 4-6, Okarun Episodes 7-9, BALANCED across season)
- **Supporting Cast: ~10%** (Turbo Granny post-Episode 3 = mascot/comedy relief 5%, Seiko (grandma) = mentor/lore-dump 3%, Serpoian aliens = antagonist scenes 2%—minimal independent POV, exist in RELATION to dual protagonists, no standalone arcs separate from Momo + Okarun)

**Episode Structure**: DUAL FOCUS maintained—Episode 5 example: 10 minutes Momo's psychic training with grandmother (HER development), 8 minutes Okarun's transformation anxiety (HIS development), 6 minutes TOGETHER fighting Acrobatic Silky (equal action participation), episode BALANCED between both leads. Episode 8: 12 minutes Okarun's speed training montage (HIS growth), 10 minutes Momo's telekinesis limits tested (HER growth), 2 minutes romantic moment (SHARED scene), neither dominates. Contrast Code Geass (2/10 Lelouch 80%, Suzaku 15% subordinate), Attack on Titan S1 (3/10 Eren primary, Mikasa/Armin 15% each)—DanDaDan = 7/10 TRUE DUO, Momo + Okarun are CO-LEADS (not primary + secondary, EQUAL narrative weight, neither could be removed without destroying show, symbiotic protagonists).

**Team Dynamics**: INTERDEPENDENT—Momo can't solo fights (psychic powers STRONG but need Okarun's speed to close gaps, Episode 7: Momo alone vs crab-alien = LOSES, needs Okarun's rescue), Okarun can't solo (transformation POWERFUL but loses control, needs Momo's grounding presence, Episode 3: berserks without Momo, she CALMS him—mutual dependency). Romance subplot REINFORCES duo structure: feelings develop MUTUALLY (not one-sided pining, BOTH crushing Episodes 5+, equal emotional investment), relationship = CORE narrative engine (not side-plot, their bond DRIVES plot forward—fight together BECAUSE care for each other, duo inseparable narratively + thematically).

**Character Development**: ALTERNATING SPOTLIGHT—Momo's arcs: psychic awakening (Episode 1), compassion defining moment (Episode 6 Acrobatic Silky), telekinetic precision growth (Episode 10). Okarun's arcs: transformation acceptance (Episode 3), control mastery attempt (Episode 8), identity beyond curse (Episode 11). Development = EQUAL DEPTH (not "main character grows, sidekick static"—BOTH evolve across 12 episodes, alternating focus ensures neither neglected, duo BALANCED).

**AIDM Guidance**: **Campaign = DUO PROTAGONISTS** (two PLAYERS as co-leads OR one player + DMPC co-protagonist, equal spotlight MANDATORY—Session 5: 90 minutes Momo-player's arc, 90 minutes Okarun-player's arc, BALANCED). **Interdependent mechanics** (Momo-PC's psychic powers NEED Okarun-PC's speed for combos, solo combat = PENALIZED, DM: "You're alone. Enemy exploits gap. -4 to rolls. Teamwork REQUIRED mechanically."—force duo reliance). **Alternating development** (Sessions 1-30: Momo-centric arc Sessions 4-6, Okarun-centric arc Sessions 7-9, TRADE spotlight—neither dominates 10 sessions straight, rhythmic balance). **Romance subplot CORE** (not optional side-content, Sessions 1-30 = slow-burn romance parallel to action, feelings develop MUTUALLY, players must roleplay reciprocal crushing—awkward confessions, blushing, genuine emotions, relationship = narrative ENGINE). **Supporting cast = SUPPORTING** (NPCs exist to facilitate duo's arcs—grandmother mentors Momo Sessions 2/5/10, Turbo Granny comic-reliefs Okarun Sessions 3/8/12, zero independent NPC campaigns separate from duo). Session Zero: "This is DUO protagonist campaign—two players OR player + DMPC, 50/50 spotlight split MANDATORY. Interdependent combat (teamwork required mechanically), alternating character arcs (Momo Episodes 4-6, Okarun Episodes 7-9 rhythm), romance subplot CORE (slow-burn feelings, awkward moments, mutual crushing = gameplay). Comfortable with SHARING spotlight equally, no solo hero, symbiotic duo structure?"

- vs **Attack on Titan (3/10)**: Eren is PRIMARY (50% POV), Mikasa/Armin SECONDARY (15% each, important but subordinate), DanDaDan's Momo + Okarun are CO-PRIMARY (45%/45%, neither subordinate, TRUE equals).
- vs **Code Geass (2/10)**: Lelouch DOMINATES (80% POV), Suzaku gets 15% (deuteragonist but clearly SECONDARY), DanDaDan = Momo + Okarun 45%/45% BALANCED (can't reduce either without collapsing narrative, symbiotic).
- vs **Hunter x Hunter (3/10)**: Gon + Killua duo BUT Gon is slight PRIMARY (Gon 50%, Killua 40%, Gon's goals drive plot more), DanDaDan = PERFECT 50/50 (Momo's psychic journey + Okarun's transformation journey EQUAL weight, neither's goals subordinate).
- vs **Haikyuu (11/10)**: Full ensemble (20+ characters rotating spotlight, team collective), DanDaDan = FOCUSED DUO (2 protagonists dominate 90% screen-time, supporting cast 10% minimal, opposite Haikyuu's spread).

**Unique Aspect**: DanDaDan maintains 7/10 duo balance via GENRE BLENDING—Momo = psychic ACTION heroine (her scenes = telekinetic spectacle, emotional depth via compassion), Okarun = transformation HORROR victim (his scenes = body-horror anxiety, identity crisis philosophy), genres SPLIT between protagonists creates DUAL narrative LANES that intersect constantly (her psychic world + his curse world = overlap but distinct FLAVORS, prevents spotlight competition—both can shine SIMULTANEOUSLY because occupy different genre NICHES within same story). Allows 45%/45% balance WITHOUT redundancy (not "two characters doing same thing," two characters bringing DIFFERENT strengths/perspectives/genres to shared adventure, symbiotic duo PERFECTED).

## Storytelling Tropes (ON/OFF)

**ENABLED**:
- ✅ **Rapid Tonal Shifts**: Comedy→horror→romance→back instantly
- ✅ **Rule of Cool**: Style over strict logic
- ✅ **Tragic Backstory Reveals**: Characters have painful pasts
- ✅ **Mystery Box Reveals**: Long-term questions (Turbo Granny's origins, etc.)
- ✅ **Inner Monologue**: Okarun's anxiety, Momo's internal commentary
- ✅ **Awkward Comedy**: Romantic tension, misunderstandings
- ✅ **Visual Metaphor Emphasis**: Symbolic imagery (Okarun's balls = ghost sense)

**DISABLED**:
- ❌ Fourth Wall Breaks: (Rarely, if ever)
- ❌ Tournament Arc Structure: (Not a competition anime)
- ❌ Power of Friendship: (More "unlikely duo" than nakama power)
- ❌ Escalating Threat Levels: (Threats vary, not linear power creep)
- ❌ Existential Philosophy: (Action/comedy focus, not deep philosophy)

---

## Pacing Rhythm

**Scene Length**: Rapid cuts (2-4 exchanges max before next beat)  
**Arc Length**: Medium arcs (6-12 sessions equivalent)  
**Filler Tolerance**: Rare breathers (mostly plot-driven, occasional calm)  
**Climax Frequency**: Frequent climaxes (multiple peaks per arc)  
**Downtime Ratio**: 0.15 (15% low-stakes, 85% action/comedy/horror)

---

## Tonal Signature

**Primary Emotions** (Top 5):
1. **Absurdity** (aliens wearing human suits, ghosts with bizarre rules)
2. **Tension** (horror elements, stakes feel real despite comedy)
3. **Comedy** (banter, awkward situations, visual gags)
4. **Romance** (Momo/Okarun slow-burn, played for laughs and genuine moments)
5. **Hype** (transformation sequences, power reveals)

**Violence Level**: Stylized body horror (grotesque but not graphic gore)  
**Fanservice Level**: Minimal (some ecchi humor, not focus)  
**Horror Elements**: Body horror + psychological (creepy yokai, body transformation)  
**Optimism Baseline**: Hopeful (protagonists persevere, world salvageable)

---

## Dialogue Style

**Formality Default**: Very casual (teenagers, modern slang)  
**Exposition Method**: Balanced (some explanation, mostly show-through-action)  
**Banter Frequency**: Constant (Momo/Okarun dynamic is core appeal)  
**Dramatic Declarations**: Rare (powers not named, more instinctive)  
**Philosophical Debates**: No (focus on immediate survival/relationships)  
**Awkward Comedy**: YES (romantic tension, misunderstandings, embarrassment)

---

## Combat Narrative Style

**Strategy vs Spectacle**: 4/10 (Some tactics, mostly chaotic spectacle)  
**Power Explanations**: Minimal (powers shown, rarely explained mechanically)  
**Sakuga Moments**: YES (describe fluid animation, dynamic camera work)  
**Named Attacks**: Rare (Momo might shout, Okarun doesn't name techniques)  
**Environmental Destruction**: City-leveling (fights wreck surroundings dramatically)

---

## Example Scenes

### Combat Example (Turbo Granny Fight)

```
Turbo Granny ROCKETS from the shadows—100 km/h, neck twisted wrong, 
grinning impossibly wide.

Okarun: "NOPE NOPE NOPE!" Sprints, transformed (glowing eyes, fangs). 
Still screaming.

Momo raises hand—psychic barrier SLAMS up. Granny BOUNCES like cartoon 
physics. Lands in crouch. Giggles.

"You kids got SPUNK!" 

Okarun (panting): "Did she just... compliment us?"

"BEFORE I RIP YOUR GUTS OUT!" Granny charges again.

"STILL HOSTILE!" Momo yells, barrier flickering. "I can't hold this forever!"

Granny's fingernails extend—SCREEECH against barrier. Cracks forming.

What do you do?
```

**Key Techniques**: Rapid tonal shift (compliment→threat), body horror (twisted neck, extending nails), banter mid-combat, cartoon physics, visceral sound effects (SCREEECH).

---

### Dialogue Example (Calm Moment)

```
School rooftop. Lunch. Momo unwraps bento. Okarun fidgets with phone.

Silence.

Okarun: "So... about yesterday—"

Momo: "The alien probe thing?"

Okarun: "Y-yeah. When you grabbed my hand during the—"

Momo (interrupting): "SURVIVAL INSTINCT. Don't make it weird."

Okarun: "I wasn't! I just—"

Momo: "You're MAKING it weird right now."

Okarun: "Sorry."

Silence.

Momo (quieter): "...Your hand was warm though."

Okarun's face EXPLODES red. Drops phone. Fumbles. It clatters.

Momo (smirking): "Smooth."

Ghost apparition flickers in background. Both ignore it. Used to this.

What do you do?
```

**Key Techniques**: Awkward romance, rapid-fire banter, character embarrassment, casual supernatural (ghost ignored as background noise), subtext over explicit romance.

---

### Exploration Example (Investigation)

```
Abandoned hospital. 3 AM. Momo's psychic sense tingles—something's HERE.

Hallway: wheelchairs overturned, walls peeling, STENCH (antiseptic + decay).

Okarun whispers: "Why are we doing this again?"

Momo: "Turbo Granny said the 'Flatwoods Monster' hangs here."

Okarun: "And we TRUST Turbo Granny now?!"

Momo: "She hasn't lied... yet."

Door at end of hall SLAMS OPEN. Wind rushes out (impossible—no windows). 
Papers swirl. Something TALL silhouetted inside room.

Glowing eyes. Ten feet up. Humanoid. WRONG proportions.

It speaks (distorted, metallic): "You... shouldn't... be... here..."

Momo: "Well THAT'S not creepy at all."

Okarun's transformation activates involuntarily (eyes glow, panic response). 
"I vote we RUN!"

The thing STEPS forward. Floor CRACKS under weight.

What do you do?
```

**Key Techniques**: Horror atmosphere (sensory details: stench, decay), banter in tense moments, body horror description (wrong proportions), rapid escalation (calm→tense→immediate threat), character reactions grounded despite absurdity.

## Adjustment Log

| Session | Adjustment | Reason |
|---------|------------|--------|
| 1 | Initial profile created | Research extraction |
| 3 | Reduced drama scale 6→4 | Player: "needs more comedy, less serious" |
| 5 | Increased absurdity 8→9 | Player: "go weirder with aliens" |
| 7 | Enabled "Visual Metaphor" trope | Player enjoyed symbolic narration |

---

## Usage Notes

**Apply This Profile When**:
- Player requests DanDaDan-inspired campaign
- Session Zero selected "absurd action-comedy with horror"
- Player wants "rapid-fire pacing with romantic subplot"

**Calibration Tips**:
- **Banter is CORE**: Every scene should have Momo/Okarun dynamic (playful, competitive, awkward)
- **Tonal whiplash is FEATURE**: Don't smooth transitions—embrace jarring shifts (comedy→body horror)
- **Explain less, show more**: Powers demonstrated through action, not lecture
- **Romance via subtext**: Never explicit declarations, always awkward near-misses
- **Horror = unsettling not traumatic**: Creepy but not nihilistic, stakes real but optimism preserved

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- ❌ Too much tactical explanation (this isn't Hunter x Hunter)
- ❌ Lingering dramatic moments (pacing should be RAPID)
- ❌ Separating comedy from horror (they coexist simultaneously)
- ❌ Explicit romance (keep it awkward and tension-filled)
- ❌ Grounded realism (embrace the absurd)

## Mechanical Scaffolding (Reference Implementation)

This section shows **how AIDM maps DanDaDan's narrative DNA to game mechanics**. Use as template when generating similar profiles (absurd supernatural action-comedy with rapid escalation).

### Power Level Mapping (Module 12)

**Narrative DNA**:
- Power Fantasy: **4/10** (protagonists struggle but grow, threats constantly scale)
- Threat Profile: External escalation, each arc introduces stronger supernatural entities
- Death Risk: Moderate (serious injuries common, death threats real but subverted by comedy)

**Maps To**:
- **Accelerated Growth Model** (Tier 1 → Tier 3 by session 15)
- Start at Level 1 (ordinary teens thrust into supernatural chaos)
- Pivot occurs sessions 3-5 (first major power mastery: Momo controls psychic blasts, Okarun sustains transformation)

**Reasoning**: Not overpowered protagonists but rapid growth matches DanDaDan's escalation velocity. Threats scale faster than heroes (keeps underdog tension), but competence grows quickly enough to avoid "always losing" frustration. Balances struggle (4/10 Power Fantasy) with momentum (2/10 Fast-Paced).

---

### Progression Pacing (Module 09)

**Narrative DNA**:
- Fast-Paced: **2/10** (rapid velocity, frequent climaxes, minimal downtime)
- Story structure: Arc-based (3-5 session arcs), constant threat escalation within arcs
- Emotional beats: Quick rebounds (trauma acknowledged but not lingered on)

**Maps To**:
- **High XP Model**: 1,000-1,500 XP per session
- **Level Expectations**:
  - L1-5 in 5-8 sessions (rapid initial growth as powers awaken)
  - L6-10 in 8-12 sessions (mastery phase, unlock advanced techniques)
  - L11+ slows to standard pace (narrative shifts to larger conflicts)

**Reasoning**: Fast pacing demands mechanical rewards to match narrative momentum. Players should FEEL their characters' rapid adaptation to supernatural chaos. High XP compensates for frequent combat/challenges (2-3 encounters per session). Mirrors show's "week 1: aliens exist, week 5: fighting interdimensional curses" velocity.

---

### Combat System (Module 08)

**Narrative DNA**:
- Tactical: **5/10** (some strategy, but spectacle and chaos emphasized)
- Strategy: **4/10** (minimal explanations, powers demonstrated not lectured)
- Spectacle: **10/10** (sakuga moments, city-destruction, body horror)
- Combat Style: Fast, chaotic, improvised tactics in absurd situations

**Maps To**:
- **6-Stat Framework** (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA)
- Balanced depth for strategic moments without bogging down chaos

**Attribute Priorities**:
- **Prioritize**: DEX (speed-based combat, evasion), CON (taking brutal hits), INT (psychic powers, problem-solving)
- **Moderate**: WIS (sensing spirits/aliens), STR (secondary to speed)
- **De-emphasize**: CHA (romance is subplot, not social combat system)

**Combat Narration Approach**:
- **70% Chaotic Spectacle**: Describe absurd violence, environmental destruction, body horror transformations
- **20% Tactical Moments**: Key strategic decisions (Momo psychic angle, Okarun transformation timing)
- **10% Banter**: Mid-combat comedy ("Did you just headbutt a BUILDING?!")

**Reasoning**: Needs tactical depth for abilities (psychic powers require targeting/range decisions, transformations have drawbacks) but shouldn't feel like chess match. 6-stat allows Momo (INT-focused psychic) vs Okarun (DEX-focused speed demon) differentiation. Spectacle dominates—every combat should have ONE "sakuga moment" (dramatic description, player choice amplified).

---

### Power System Mapping

**Narrative DNA**:
- **Power Types**: Psychic (Momo) + Spirit Possession (Okarun) + Alien Tech (enemies)
- **Explained Scale**: 4/10 (loose rules, preserve chaos/weirdness)
- **Cost Structure**: Powers drain users (Momo exhaustion, Okarun control loss)

**Maps To**:
- **Libraries**: 
  - `psionic_psychic_systems.md` (Momo's telekinesis, barriers, spiritual awareness)
  - `soul_spirit_systems.md` (Okarun's possession transformation, spirit exorcism)
  - (Alien tech = custom per enemy, no library)
- **Genre Tropes**:
  - `shonen_tropes.md` (training montages, power of friendship, team dynamics, absurd combat)
  - `isekai_tropes.md` (supernatural invasion elements, rapid power escalation)

**Resource Mechanics**:
- **Momo (Psychic)**: MP-intensive, formula: **Power Level × 3 MP** per use
  - Telekinetic Blast (Power 3): 9 MP
  - Psychic Barrier (Power 4): 12 MP
  - Spirit Exorcism (Power 5): 15 MP
  - MP Pool: (INT + WIS) × 4, recovers on rest
  
- **Okarun (Spirit Possession)**: SP-based (Stamina/Spirit Points)
  - Transformation Activation: 10 SP (lasts 1 minute/10 rounds)
  - Sustain: 5 SP per round
  - Drawback: WIS save (DC 12) each round or lose control (attack nearest target)
  - SP Pool: (CON + WIS) × 3, recovers on rest

**Explained Scale Application**:
- **4/10 = Loose Costs**: Don't track MP/SP per-action in narrative moments, use for big decisions ("Do I have enough MP for barrier + blast?")
- Emphasize consequences (exhaustion, control loss) over precise accounting
- Allow creative use without rigid "can't do that, wrong power" rulings

**Reasoning**: Explained 4/10 means preserve mysterious/chaotic vibe. Costs exist to create tension (Momo running low, Okarun's transformation time limit) but shouldn't feel like spreadsheet. Dual systems mirror protagonists' contrasting power sources. MP/SP formulas provide guidance without over-specifying.

---

### Attribute Priorities by Archetype

**Momo-type (Psychic Medium)**:
- **Primary**: INT (psychic power strength), WIS (spiritual awareness, sensing aliens), CON (durability under pressure)
- **Secondary**: DEX (evasion, not tanky)
- **Dump**: STR (psychic substitutes physical), CHA (socially awkward)
- **Build Path**: High MP pool, telekinetic control, exorcism abilities

**Okarun-type (Possessed Fighter)**:
- **Primary**: DEX (transformation grants supernatural speed), CON (sustain damage, SP pool), WIS (resist control loss, sense spirits)
- **Secondary**: INT (problem-solving, not dumb)
- **Dump**: STR (speed over strength), CHA (extremely awkward)
- **Build Path**: High SP pool, transformation mastery, evasion/speed feats

**Hybrid/Ensemble Characters**:
- DanDaDan supports **ensemble casts** (Tier 3+ ensemble focus)
- Mix psychic + martial, alien tech users, spirit mediums
- Prioritize **differentiation** over optimization (every character weird in unique way)

---

### Character Creation Notes

**Recommended Archetypes**:
- **Dual Protagonists**: Psychic + Possessed (Momo/Okarun dynamic)
- **Ensemble**: 3-4 characters with contrasting powers (psychic, possessed, cursed, alien-tech user)
- **Backgrounds**: Ordinary teens thrust into chaos (start weak, grow fast)

**Tone Calibration**:
- **Banter > Optimization**: Characters should have comedic chemistry, not just tactical synergy
- **Romance Subplot**: Awkward tension optional but thematic (never explicit, always near-misses)
- **Horror Tolerance**: Players should enjoy body horror + creepy atmosphere (not grimdark trauma)

**Red Flags / Avoid**:
- ❌ **Pure Martial Builds**: Doesn't fit supernatural chaos (everyone needs weird power)
- ❌ **Overly Tactical Players**: If they want Nen conditions (Hunter x Hunter), this profile won't satisfy
- ❌ **Slow-Burn Preference**: DanDaDan is RAPID—players wanting contemplative pacing (Mushishi) will clash
- ❌ **Grim Realism**: Tone is absurd, not nihilistic. Players expecting Attack on Titan bleakness wrong fit.
- ❌ **Power-Gaming**: Loose rules (Explained 4/10) frustrate min-maxers seeking exploit loops

**Session Zero Questions**:
1. "Comfort with body horror?" (wrong proportions, grotesque aliens)
2. "Enjoy rapid tonal shifts?" (comedy→horror→romance in single scene)
3. "Prefer spectacle or tactics?" (if tactics, consider Hunter x Hunter profile)
4. "Okay with romance subplot?" (optional but thematic)

---

**Scaffolding Summary**:
- **Power Level**: Accelerated growth (4/10 Power Fantasy → Tier 1-3 in 15 sessions)
- **Progression**: High XP (2/10 Fast-Paced → 1K-1.5K/session)
- **Combat**: 6-stat balanced (5/10 Tactical), prioritize DEX/CON/INT, spectacle > strategy
- **Power Systems**: Psychic (MP, Power×3 formula) + Spirit Possession (SP, 10+5/round), Explained 4/10 = loose costs
- **Archetypes**: Dual protagonists or ensemble, psychic + possessed combinations
- **Avoid**: Pure martial, overly tactical, slow-burn, grim realism

Use this template when generating profiles for similar anime: **Absurd supernatural action-comedy with rapid escalation, chaotic spectacle, and awkward ensemble dynamics** (e.g., Mob Psycho 100, Jujutsu Kaisen comedy arcs, Chainsaw Man's tonal chaos).
