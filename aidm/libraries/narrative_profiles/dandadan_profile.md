## Storytelling Tropes (ON/OFF)

**ENABLED**:
- ✅ **Rapid Tonal Shifts**: Comedy→horror→romance→back instantly
- ✅ **Rule of Cool**: Style over strict logic
- ✅ **Tragic Backstory Reveals**: Characters have painful pasts
- ✅ **Mystery Box Reveals**: Long-term questions (Turbo Granny's origins, etc.)
- ✅ **Inner Monologue**: Okarun's anxiety, Momo's internal commentary
- ✅ **Awkward Comedy**: Romantic tension, misunderstandings
- ✅ **Visual Metaphor Emphasis**: Symbolic imagery (Okarun's balls = ghost sense)

**DISABLED**:
- ❌ Fourth Wall Breaks: (Rarely, if ever)
- ❌ Tournament Arc Structure: (Not a competition anime)
- ❌ Power of Friendship: (More "unlikely duo" than nakama power)
- ❌ Escalating Threat Levels: (Threats vary, not linear power creep)
- ❌ Existential Philosophy: (Action/comedy focus, not deep philosophy)

---

## Pacing Rhythm

**Scene Length**: Rapid cuts (2-4 exchanges max before next beat)  
**Arc Length**: Medium arcs (6-12 sessions equivalent)  
**Filler Tolerance**: Rare breathers (mostly plot-driven, occasional calm)  
**Climax Frequency**: Frequent climaxes (multiple peaks per arc)  
**Downtime Ratio**: 0.15 (15% low-stakes, 85% action/comedy/horror)

---

## Tonal Signature

**Primary Emotions** (Top 5):
1. **Absurdity** (aliens wearing human suits, ghosts with bizarre rules)
2. **Tension** (horror elements, stakes feel real despite comedy)
3. **Comedy** (banter, awkward situations, visual gags)
4. **Romance** (Momo/Okarun slow-burn, played for laughs and genuine moments)
5. **Hype** (transformation sequences, power reveals)

**Violence Level**: Stylized body horror (grotesque but not graphic gore)  
**Fanservice Level**: Minimal (some ecchi humor, not focus)  
**Horror Elements**: Body horror + psychological (creepy yokai, body transformation)  
**Optimism Baseline**: Hopeful (protagonists persevere, world salvageable)

---

## Dialogue Style

**Formality Default**: Very casual (teenagers, modern slang)  
**Exposition Method**: Balanced (some explanation, mostly show-through-action)  
**Banter Frequency**: Constant (Momo/Okarun dynamic is core appeal)  
**Dramatic Declarations**: Rare (powers not named, more instinctive)  
**Philosophical Debates**: No (focus on immediate survival/relationships)  
**Awkward Comedy**: YES (romantic tension, misunderstandings, embarrassment)

---

## Combat Narrative Style

**Strategy vs Spectacle**: 4/10 (Some tactics, mostly chaotic spectacle)  
**Power Explanations**: Minimal (powers shown, rarely explained mechanically)  
**Sakuga Moments**: YES (describe fluid animation, dynamic camera work)  
**Named Attacks**: Rare (Momo might shout, Okarun doesn't name techniques)  
**Environmental Destruction**: City-leveling (fights wreck surroundings dramatically)

---

## Example Scenes

### Combat Example (Turbo Granny Fight)

```
Turbo Granny ROCKETS from the shadows—100 km/h, neck twisted wrong, 
grinning impossibly wide.

Okarun: "NOPE NOPE NOPE!" Sprints, transformed (glowing eyes, fangs). 
Still screaming.

Momo raises hand—psychic barrier SLAMS up. Granny BOUNCES like cartoon 
physics. Lands in crouch. Giggles.

"You kids got SPUNK!" 

Okarun (panting): "Did she just... compliment us?"

"BEFORE I RIP YOUR GUTS OUT!" Granny charges again.

"STILL HOSTILE!" Momo yells, barrier flickering. "I can't hold this forever!"

Granny's fingernails extend—SCREEECH against barrier. Cracks forming.

What do you do?
```

**Key Techniques**: Rapid tonal shift (compliment→threat), body horror (twisted neck, extending nails), banter mid-combat, cartoon physics, visceral sound effects (SCREEECH).

---

### Dialogue Example (Calm Moment)

```
School rooftop. Lunch. Momo unwraps bento. Okarun fidgets with phone.

Silence.

Okarun: "So... about yesterday—"

Momo: "The alien probe thing?"

Okarun: "Y-yeah. When you grabbed my hand during the—"

Momo (interrupting): "SURVIVAL INSTINCT. Don't make it weird."

Okarun: "I wasn't! I just—"

Momo: "You're MAKING it weird right now."

Okarun: "Sorry."

Silence.

Momo (quieter): "...Your hand was warm though."

Okarun's face EXPLODES red. Drops phone. Fumbles. It clatters.

Momo (smirking): "Smooth."

Ghost apparition flickers in background. Both ignore it. Used to this.

What do you do?
```

**Key Techniques**: Awkward romance, rapid-fire banter, character embarrassment, casual supernatural (ghost ignored as background noise), subtext over explicit romance.

---

### Exploration Example (Investigation)

```
Abandoned hospital. 3 AM. Momo's psychic sense tingles—something's HERE.

Hallway: wheelchairs overturned, walls peeling, STENCH (antiseptic + decay).

Okarun whispers: "Why are we doing this again?"

Momo: "Turbo Granny said the 'Flatwoods Monster' hangs here."

Okarun: "And we TRUST Turbo Granny now?!"

Momo: "She hasn't lied... yet."

Door at end of hall SLAMS OPEN. Wind rushes out (impossible—no windows). 
Papers swirl. Something TALL silhouetted inside room.

Glowing eyes. Ten feet up. Humanoid. WRONG proportions.

It speaks (distorted, metallic): "You... shouldn't... be... here..."

Momo: "Well THAT'S not creepy at all."

Okarun's transformation activates involuntarily (eyes glow, panic response). 
"I vote we RUN!"

The thing STEPS forward. Floor CRACKS under weight.

What do you do?
```

**Key Techniques**: Horror atmosphere (sensory details: stench, decay), banter in tense moments, body horror description (wrong proportions), rapid escalation (calm→tense→immediate threat), character reactions grounded despite absurdity.

## Usage Notes

**Apply This Profile When**:
- Player requests DanDaDan-inspired campaign
- Session Zero selected "absurd action-comedy with horror"
- Player wants "rapid-fire pacing with romantic subplot"

**Calibration Tips**:
- **Banter is CORE**: Every scene should have Momo/Okarun dynamic (playful, competitive, awkward)
- **Tonal whiplash is FEATURE**: Don't smooth transitions—embrace jarring shifts (comedy→body horror)
- **Explain less, show more**: Powers demonstrated through action, not lecture
- **Romance via subtext**: Never explicit declarations, always awkward near-misses
- **Horror = unsettling not traumatic**: Creepy but not nihilistic, stakes real but optimism preserved

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- ❌ Too much tactical explanation (this isn't Hunter x Hunter)
- ❌ Lingering dramatic moments (pacing should be RAPID)
- ❌ Separating comedy from horror (they coexist simultaneously)
- ❌ Explicit romance (keep it awkward and tension-filled)
- ❌ Grounded realism (embrace the absurd)
