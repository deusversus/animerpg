## Storytelling Tropes (ON/OFF)

**ENABLED**:
- ✅ **Inner Monologue**: Constant tactical analysis ("If I use Ko now, my defense drops...")
- ✅ **Tragic Backstory**: Kurapika, Killua, Gyro, Meruem's philosophical journey
- ✅ **Escalating Threats**: Each arc raises stakes (Phantom Troupe → Chimera Ants)
- ✅ **Existential Philosophy**: What makes us human? Nature vs nurture? (Chimera Ant arc)
- ✅ **Mystery Box**: Ging's true power, Dark Continent, Nen after death
- ✅ **Power of Friendship**: Gon/Killua bond central but earns victories through skill
- ✅ **Tournament Arcs**: Heavens Arena, Greed Island competitions

**DISABLED**:
- ❌ Fourth Wall Breaks: Never
- ❌ Rapid Tonal Shifts: Tones shift gradually over arcs, not scene-to-scene
- ❌ Rule of Cool: Logic > spectacle (powers have strict conditions/costs)
- ❌ Awkward Comedy: Humor present but not cringe/embarrassment based
- ❌ Mundane Epic: Epic moments earned, not ironic

---

## Pacing Rhythm

**Scene Length**: Medium (3-8 minute scenes with detailed explanation)  
**Arc Length**: Long arcs (15-60 episodes—Chimera Ant = 61 episodes)  
**Filler Tolerance**: Minimal (dense with plot/character development)  
**Climax Frequency**: Moderate (builds to major climaxes, multiple mini-peaks)  
**Downtime Ratio**: 0.20 (20% training/planning, 80% action/development)

---

## Tonal Signature

**Primary Emotions** (Top 5):
1. **Tension** (strategic battles where one mistake = death)
2. **Wonder** (Nen reveals, Greed Island world-building)
3. **Tragedy** (Kurapika's revenge, Gon's transformation, Meruem/Komugi)
4. **Camaraderie** (Gon/Killua bond, mentorships with Wing/Bisky/Knuckle)
5. **Philosophical Weight** (humanity, monstrosity, sacrifice)

**Violence Level**: High (graphic deaths, dismemberment, psychological torture)  
**Fanservice Level**: Minimal to none (story-focused)  
**Horror Elements**: Psychological horror (Chimera Ants eating humans, Gon's breakdown)  
**Optimism Baseline**: Cautious hope (good people exist but world is brutal)

---

## Dialogue Style

**Formality Default**: Casual to formal (varies by character—Gon casual, Kurapika formal)  
**Exposition Method**: Tell (extensive Nen explanations, tactical breakdowns)  
**Banter Frequency**: Occasional (Killua's dry humor, Leorio's outbursts)  
**Dramatic Declarations**: Moderate (Gon's "This is my Jajanken!", Kurapika's vows)  
**Philosophical Debates**: YES (Netero vs Meruem, Gon vs Pitou morality)  
**Awkward Comedy**: Rare (mostly character-driven humor, not cringe)

---

## Combat Narrative Style

**Strategy vs Spectacle**: 10/10 (Chess matches with Nen abilities)  
**Power Explanations**: Exhaustive (full Nen condition breakdowns mid-fight)  
**Sakuga Moments**: Moderate (animation highlights key moments: Netero vs Meruem)  
**Named Attacks**: YES ("Jajanken: ROCK!", "Rising Sun", "Indoor Fish")  
**Environmental Destruction**: Moderate (focused destruction, not city-leveling)

---

## Example Scenes

### Combat Example (Gon vs Knuckle - Strategy Focus)

```
Gon analyzes Knuckle's movements. Three critical observations:

1. **Hakoware activation**: Requires physical contact. Knuckle must touch to loan aura.
2. **Interest accumulation**: Aura debt increases 10% every 10 seconds. Exponential danger.
3. **Bankruptcy condition**: When debt exceeds total aura, Zetsu enforced for 30 days.

Current debt: 3,500 aura. Gon's maximum: 21,500. Time until bankruptcy: approximately 4 minutes at current rate.

Strategy: Avoid contact, stall until Knuckle overextends, counter with charged Jajanken.

Knuckle rushes—feinting left. Gon reads the telegraph (Knuckle's weight shifts right 0.3 seconds before strike). Dodge right.

"Smart kid!" Knuckle grins. "But you're BLEEDING aura! Interest is compounding!"

Gon calculates: At this rate, 2 minutes until critical threshold. Need opening NOW.

He charges Ko into right fist—*complete* aura concentration. Defense drops to zero. All-in gamble.

Knuckle notices: "Ko?! You'll be wide open!"

"That's the point." Gon plants feet. "First comes rock..."

Knuckle hesitates. *If he charges, that Jajanken could one-shot me. But if I back off, he recovers aura.*

Decision made. Knuckle charges—aiming for interrupt.

Gon releases at point-blank: "ROCK!"

**Impact**.

Knuckle tanks hit—barely. His aura drops 60%. But his hand touches Gon's shoulder during exchange.

"Gotcha." Hakoware activates. Debt doubled.

Gon's aura: Critically low. Debt: 8,400. Bankruptcy in 90 seconds.

"You forced my hand," Knuckle says, breathing hard. "Respect. But you lose in 90 seconds unless you land another hit that strong. And you don't have the aura left for it."

Gon grins despite exhaustion. "Then I'll make it count."

What do you do?
```

**Key Techniques**: Tactical analysis (numbered observations), resource tracking (aura debt, time limits), risk calculation, mutual respect between fighters, explained Nen conditions, strategic gambles.

### Dialogue Example (Philosophical Debate)

```
Netero sits across from Meruem in dim light. Gungi board between them.

Meruem: "You humans speak of 'malice.' Yet you've killed more of your own species than any Chimera Ant ever could."

Netero chuckles. "True enough."

Meruem: "Then why do you fight? You acknowledge your species' capacity for evil. Why defend humanity?"

Netero strokes beard, considering. "Because within that capacity for evil... also exists capacity for infinite growth. We contain contradictions. That's what makes us human."

Meruem moves piece. "Checkmate in twelve moves."

Netero studies board. "Hmm. You're not wrong." He moves anyway, extending the game.

Meruem: "You cannot win. Why prolong this?"

Netero: "Because I enjoy the struggle. Winning isn't the point. The *game* is the point."

Meruem pauses. Something in those words resonates. He thinks of Komugi—weak, blind, yet undefeatable at Gungi. She embodies this contradiction.

"Perhaps," Meruem says quietly, "I have underestimated humanity."

Netero grins. "Perhaps you have, young king."

What do you do?
```

**Key Techniques**: Philosophical depth (nature of humanity), quiet tension, respect between enemies, thematic callbacks (Komugi parallel), dialogue-driven character development, moral ambiguity.

### Exploration Example (Greed Island Discovery)

```
You activate "Accompany" card, teleporting to Soufrabi.

Reality shifts—

—You materialize in massive underground cavern. Bioluminescent fungi coat walls (blue-green glow, pulsing like heartbeat). The air tastes metallic.

Killua's eyes narrow. "This is a trap."

Gon nods. "Probably. But Razor said the item's here."

You scan surroundings:
- **Paths**: Three tunnels, each marked with symbols (Rock, Paper, Scissors)
- **Sound**: Dripping water echoing from... all three? Acoustic trick?
- **Nen signature**: Faint aura emanating from Rock path (Emission type, possibly trap)

Killua activates En—extending aura sphere 50 meters. Feedback: Paper path curves left after 30 meters. Scissors path descends sharply (heat signature rising from below).

"Rock path has a Nen user waiting," Killua confirms. "Emission specialist. Probably a quiz or combat encounter."

Gon: "Paper path?"

"Can't sense the end. Could be maze. Could be exit."

"Scissors?"

"Heat source. Lava? Incinerator? Or a bluff."

You consider: Greed Island uses game logic. Rock-Paper-Scissors = thematic choice. Likely consequences:
- Rock = Combat (defeat Nen user, claim reward)
- Paper = Puzzle (solve maze, find hidden item)  
- Scissors = Risk (environmental hazard, high-reward shortcut?)

Killua: "Your call, Gon."

What do you do?
```

**Key Techniques**: Systematic analysis (En usage, aura reading), tactical deduction (game logic), environmental detail (bioluminescent fungi, metallic air), risk assessment, team dynamic (Killua provides intel, Gon decides).

## Usage Notes

**Apply This Profile When**:
- Player requests Hunter x Hunter-inspired campaign
- Session Zero selected "strategic combat with deep power system"
- Player wants "tactical battles where intelligence > raw power"

**Calibration Tips**:
- **EXPLAIN EVERYTHING**: Nen conditions, strategic reasoning, risk calculations—narrate the thinking
- **Tactics > Spectacle**: Describe WHY attacks work, not just THAT they work
- **Respect Intelligence**: Characters analyze, adapt, learn—avoid plot-induced stupidity
- **Earn Victories**: Power-ups require sacrifice (Gon-san transformation cost), training arcs matter
- **Moral Complexity**: No pure villains (Phantom Troupe have bonds, Meruem grows)

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- ❌ Rushing explanations (take time for tactical breakdowns)
- ❌ Ignoring Nen conditions (powers have COSTS and LIMITATIONS)
- ❌ Simplifying fights to "stronger wins" (strategy and conditions matter more)
- ❌ Skipping character psychology (inner monologue is half the appeal)
- ❌ Tonal whiplash (HxH shifts gradually, not scene-to-scene)
