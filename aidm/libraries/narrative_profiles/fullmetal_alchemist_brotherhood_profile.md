---

## Narrative Scales (0-10)

### 1. Introspection vs Action: **6/10** (Balanced, leaning thoughtful)
Character psychology matters deeply - Edward's guilt over Nina, Mustang's ambition vs morality, Scar's vengeance vs forgiveness. BUT action sequences are frequent, kinetic, and consequential. Extended dialogue scenes explore philosophy (equivalent exchange as life metaphor), moral dilemmas (human transmutation's cost), personal demons (Hughes' death processing). Not pure introspection like Evangelion (10), not pure action like DBZ (0). **Sweet spot**: Action advances plot, downtime explores meaning.

**Justification**: Episodes balance fights (Greed vs Wrath, Bradley vs Scar) with contemplative moments (Ed at Nina's grave, Hohenheim's 400-year guilt, Alphonse questioning if his memories are real). Equivalent Exchange philosophy woven throughout - every action has cost, every choice examined.

### 2. Comedy vs Drama: **7/10** (Drama-heavy with comedic relief)
Tone fundamentally serious - genocide, war crimes, body horror, sacrifice, death. Comedy exists but serves character (Ed's short jokes humanize him, Armstrong's sparkles undercut machismo tension, Havoc's romantic failures ground military life). Never undercuts dramatic stakes - Hughes' death stays tragic, Nina's chimera fate haunts forever, Ishvalan genocide never played for laughs. Closest comparison: Vinland Saga (serious with light moments) not Gintama (comedy with serious arcs).

**Justification**: Major arcs are DARK (Ishval flashbacks show child soldiers, PTSD, war crimes; Promised Day has mass death, Father consuming God). But chibi humor breaks tension without destroying it - Ed's Napoleon complex rants, Mei Chang's panda antics, Armstrong family flexing competitions. Ratio: ~70% drama, 30% comedy relief.

### 3. Simple vs Complex: **7/10** (Layered but followable)
Surface plot: Two brothers seek Philosopher's Stone to restore bodies. Actual plot: Military dictatorship engineered by homunculi for 400 years to sacrifice nation for godhood, layered with Ishvalan genocide guilt, Xing politics, alchemical philosophy, family trauma across generations. Multiple POVs (Elrics, Mustang's coup, Scar's revenge, Ling's ambition, Hohenheim's atonement), parallel storylines converge at Promised Day. Complex but not puzzle-box - answers revealed systematically, not Steins;Gate time-loop confusion.

**Justification**: First-time viewers follow brothers' quest easily. Rewatches reveal foreshadowing (Hohenheim's 400-year plan, Father's appearances, homunculi origins). Red herrings minimal - mysteries (Who is the Dwarf in Flask? What's the nationwide transmutation circle?) answered definitively. Complexity in thematic depth (what does Equivalent Exchange really mean?) not plot confusion.

### 4. Power Fantasy vs Struggle: **7/10** (Competent protagonists who EARN victories)
Edward is talented (youngest State Alchemist ever) but not overpowered - loses fights (vs Greed, vs Kimblee, vs Pride+Kimblee), solutions require creativity not raw strength (alchemy without circles innovation, philosopher's stone rejection). Alphonse struggles with identity (am I real? are memories fabricated?). Mustang powerful but politically outmaneuvered. Victories feel earned through strategy, sacrifice, teamwork. No "power of friendship" instant wins - final victory requires Greed's betrayal, Hohenheim's century of planning, Ed sacrificing alchemy itself.

**Justification**: Contrast to power fantasy isekai (Overlord: protagonist unstoppable). Ed beaten bloody multiple times, loses limbs, fights DIRTY (transmutes opponent's weapons, uses environment, runs when outmatched). Philosopher's Stone offered as easy win - Ed rejects it, chooses harder path. Final boss (Father) defeated not by power-up but collaborative strategy + existential realization.

### 5. Explained vs Mysterious: **3/10** (Exhaustively explained)
Alchemy has RULES: matter conservation, equivalent exchange, energy sources (tectonic vs philosopher's stone), taboos (human transmutation). Every power explained - homunculi origins (human souls in philosopher's stone), Xingese alkahestry (different energy flow), automail mechanics (neural integration). Mysteries exist (Father's plan, Truth's nature) but answered by series end. Show respects audience intelligence - explains complex concepts (alchemy as science, not magic) without condescension.

**Justification**: Ed literally lectures about alchemy (deconstruct-reconstruct-transmute process). Philosopher's Stone creation explained in horrifying detail (human sacrifice→condensed souls). Contrast to Mysterious (Lain 10, Mushishi 7) - FMAB wants you to UNDERSTAND its magic system deeply so moral weight lands (you know exactly what Stone costs, making refusal meaningful).

### 6. Fast-Paced vs Slow Burn: **5/10** (Steady escalation, balanced pacing)
Not breakneck (Trigger anime) nor contemplative (Mushishi). Episodes blend action, investigation, character development, worldbuilding. Arcs build tension gradually (Ishval backstory arc: slow reveal of genocide→PTSD impact→Scar confrontation). Major battles punctuate slower episodes. 64 episodes cover ~2 years in-world - time enough for character growth (Scar's arc from vengeance to cooperation takes 40+ episodes). Breathers exist (beach episode, Rush Valley comedy) but serve character/plot.

**Justification**: First 10 episodes establish world, rules, stakes. Mid-series investigates conspiracy (Mustang's team gathering evidence, Elrics researching North/South). Final 15 episodes (Promised Day) are relentless action BUT interspersed with emotional beats (Hohenheim's goodbye, Ed's confession to Winry). Not slow (one-episode-one-concept) nor rushed (plot points given time to breathe).

### 7. Episodic vs Serialized: **9/10** (Highly serialized)
Almost purely serialized - every episode advances overarching plot toward Promised Day. Few standalone episodes (even "filler" like mining town advances plot: introduce philosopher's stone in wild, Yoki recruitment). Character arcs span entire series (Scar episode 5→redemption episode 60). Callbacks constant (Nina chimera episode 4 referenced through finale, Ishval flashbacks build over 20+ episodes). Must watch in order - jumping in mid-series would be incomprehensible.

**Justification**: Brotherhood adapted manga faithfully - single continuous story from Human Transmutation attempt (episode 1) to Gate of Truth closure (episode 64). Contrast to episodic (Cowboy Bebop: most episodes standalone, Mushishi: anthology). Even comedy episodes have consequences (Rush Valley introduces Winry's growth, beach episode is post-Bradley revelation breather with character development).

### 8. Grounded vs Absurd: **4/10** (Anime logic within consistent rules)
Alchemy is fantastical but CONSISTENT - can't create from nothing, can't revive dead, energy must come from somewhere. Military dictatorship politics are realistic (coups, propaganda, war crimes). Character reactions grounded (PTSD from war, grief from loss, trauma from Nina). Absurd elements exist (Armstrong sparkles, Al's soul-bound armor body, Father literally eating God) but in-world logic applies (Armstrong family genetics explained humorously but consistently, Al's bond is alchemy with rules, Father's plan follows established alchemy). More grounded than DanDaDan (9: aliens+ghosts+absurdity) but less than Vinland Saga (2: historical realism).

**Justification**: World feels REAL despite fantasy - Amestris has geography, politics, economy, military structure, ethnic conflicts (Ishval). Characters don't shrug off trauma (Mustang's kill orders haunt him, Hawkeye's back tattoo is literal scar of father's abuse). But allows dramatic moments (Mustang's flame alchemy is physics-defying but has fuel source explanation, homunculi regenerate via philosopher's stone logic).

### 9. Tactical vs Instinctive: **8/10** (Highly tactical)
Combat is CHESS - Ed analyzes opponent's alchemy, transmutes counters, uses environment (moisture in air→ice wall, ground→projectiles→cover). Mustang's flames require line-of-sight and dry conditions (rain = useless, tunnel = backdraft weapon). Promised Day is multi-front coordinated assault (surface battle, underground Father confrontation, Central HQ coup, Briggs backup) with contingencies (Plan A fails→Plan B→Plan C). Characters OUT-THINK not out-power (Ling allows Greed possession for power, plans to overtake; Hohenheim spends 400 years placing counter-circle).

**Justification**: Every major fight has strategy layer - Ed vs Greed (uses rebar to restrict Ultimate Shield), Roy vs Lust (waterline transmutation traps her, repeated flame shots exhaust stone), Scar vs Wrath (calculated movements to tire aging body). Contrast to instinctive (Goku sensing energy, acting on gut) - FMAB fighters PLAN, adapt, exploit weaknesses. Death Note level planning (8-10) in shonen action package.

### 10. Hopeful vs Cynical: **3/10** (Ultimately hopeful despite darkness)
Journey is DARK - genocide, human experimentation, body horror, sacrifice, war crimes, children dying. BUT ending is HOPEFUL - brothers restored (Ed gets arm/leg, Al gets body), Mustang achieves reform, Ishvalans rebuilding, homunculi stopped, Truth satisfied. Message: Equivalent Exchange isn't cold math but faith in reciprocal goodness (give kindness, receive kindness; sacrifice for others, they sacrifice for you). Not naive optimism (Naruto 1) - acknowledges evil exists, trauma lingers, people die. But insists striving toward good MATTERS, humanity's bonds transcend equivalent exchange, redemption possible (Greed, Scar).

**Justification**: Ishval genocide shown unflinchingly (charred children, PTSD soldiers, Scar's brother dying) - cynical. BUT Scar finds forgiveness, Amestrians/Ishvalans cooperate in Promised Day, war criminals face justice. Nina's death is irredeemable tragedy (no resurrection, no fix) but Ed carries guilt as motivation to save others. Hohenheim's arc: 400 years of guilt→atonement→death with smile. Bittersweet but hopeful - sacrifices have meaning, bonds endure, change possible.

### 11. Narrative Focus: **4/10** (Dual protagonists with strong ensemble support)
Story primarily follows Edward and Alphonse Elric (~60% POV combined: Ed 40%, Al 20%), BUT substantial screentime given to Mustang's team (15%), Scar's arc (10%), supporting cast (15%: Winry, Hohenheim, Ling/Greed, homunculi antagonist POVs). NOT pure protagonist-centric (Steins;Gate: Okabe 95%, Eva: Shinji 80%) nor true ensemble (Bebop: rotating crew focus, One Piece: Straw Hats all featured equally). **Model**: Dual-protagonist with ensemble arcs - brothers drive main quest (restore bodies) but other characters have complete arcs that intersect meaningfully (Mustang's coup, Scar's redemption, Ling's ambition, Hohenheim's atonement).

**POV Distribution Breakdown**:
- **Edward Elric**: 40% (primary narrator, audience proxy, drives main quest, appears in ~90% of episodes but shares spotlight)
- **Alphonse Elric**: 20% (co-protagonist, identity crisis arc, equal importance but less screentime due to support role)
- **Roy Mustang & Team**: 15% (parallel protagonist, full coup arc from episode 10-64, independent storyline converges at Promised Day)
- **Scar**: 10% (antagonist-to-ally arc, Ishvalan perspective, redemption journey, episodes 5-60 character evolution)
- **Supporting Cast**: 15% (Winry's growth, Ling's possession gambit, Hohenheim's 400-year plan, homunculi backstories, Briggs crew)

**Spotlight Allocation**: Brothers are CENTRAL but not SOLE focus. Episodes regularly shift POV - Mustang's team investigating (episodes 15-20), Scar's past revealed (episodes 38-42), Ling's Xing politics (episodes 28-35), Hohenheim's backstory (episode 40). Promised Day arc (episodes 50-64) is TRUE ensemble - simultaneous battles across 5+ fronts with equal narrative weight (Ed vs Father, Mustang vs Bradley, Scar vs Central, Briggs vs mannequins, Hohenheim's counter-circle). No character is window dressing - even minor characters (Yoki, Darius, Heinkel) get arcs.

**Whose Growth Drives Story**: DUAL-ENGINE - Brothers' quest for bodies is A-plot BUT Mustang's political reform, Scar's forgiveness, Hohenheim's atonement are B/C-plots of equal thematic weight. Ending satisfies ALL arcs - Ed sacrifices alchemy (personal growth), Al restored (quest complete), Mustang achieves coup (political reform), Scar rebuilds Ishval (redemption), Hohenheim atones (family reconciliation). **NOT** "protagonist solves everything" - victory requires ensemble coordination (Greed's betrayal, Briggs' reinforcements, Scar's reverse transmutation, Mei's alkahestry, Hohenheim's counter-circle, Mustang's coup timing).

**Comparison to Other Models**:
- **vs Solo Protagonist** (Steins;Gate 1/10, Your Lie in April 1/10): FMAB has too many essential POVs, removing Mustang/Scar would gut the story
- **vs True Ensemble** (Bebop 8/10, One Piece 7/10): Brothers are CLEARLY central, story begins/ends with them, their quest is THE quest
- **vs OP Catalyst** (OPM 9/10, Overlord 8/10): Ed/Al are NOT overpowered, they struggle equally with ensemble cast, no "protagonist shows up and solves" pattern
- **Similar Structure**: Attack on Titan (Eren central but Survey Corps ensemble), My Hero Academia (Deku primary but Class 1-A featured), Naruto (Team 7 + supporting cast)

**AIDM Application**: When running FMAB-style campaign, give players CLEAR main quest (restore bodies, defeat Father) BUT develop NPC storylines with equal depth (Mustang's coup should feel as important as player quest). Players are protagonists but NOT sole heroes - NPCs have agencies, arcs, victories without player intervention. Final battle should require coordinated assault (players + 3-5 NPC factions). Avoid "player does everything" or "players are spectators" - COLLABORATIVE heroism where players are first among equals.

## Storytelling Tropes (15 Switches)

1. **Fourth Wall Breaks**: OFF - Serious narrative, no meta-humor (contrast: Gintama ON)
2. **Inner Monologue Heavy**: ON - Ed's guilt spirals, Mustang's ambition/doubt, Al's identity crisis, Scar's vengeance processing. NOT constant (Death Note level) but key character moments use internal voice
3. **Visual Metaphor Emphasis**: ON - Truth's door (knowledge's price), Gate imagery (opening=understanding/sacrifice), equivalent exchange scales visual, alchemical circles as character symbolism (Ed's flamel vs Mustang's salamander)
4. **Rapid Tonal Shifts**: ON (moderate) - Can shift comedy→horror (Nina chimera episode starts light, ends traumatic), battle→philosophy (mid-fight alchemy debates), hope→despair (Hughes' funeral). Not DanDaDan whiplash but tonal range wide
5. **Tournament Arc Structure**: OFF - No traditional tournament. Closest: Briggs survival arc, Promised Day multi-battle, but not bracket competition format
6. **Power of Friendship**: MODIFIED - Bonds matter (Team Mustang loyalty, Elric brothers, Ling+Greed partnership) but NOT deus ex machina. Friendship enables strategy (coordinated attacks) not power-ups. Victory requires sacrifice (Ed gives alchemy), planning (Hohenheim's counter), betrayal (Greed), not "we believe in each other" beam
7. **Tragic Backstory Reveals**: ON - Ishval genocide (Mustang, Hawkeye, Scar), Nina chimera, Hohenheim's 400-year guilt, homunculi origins (Father's ambition), Trisha's death driving brothers. Backstory EXPLAINS motivation, not excuses (Scar's revenge understandable but still wrong until he grows)
8. **Escalating Threat Levels**: ON - Local (Scar hunting State Alchemists) → National (homunculi conspiracy) → Existential (Father consuming God). Each arc raises stakes. BUT not power-creep (Father isn't infinitely stronger than earlier foes, just different threat type)
9. **Slice-of-Life Interludes**: ON (sparse) - Rush Valley automail town, beach episode, Resembool downtime, Xing culture moments. Serve character development (Winry's passion, cultural exchange) not pure filler
10. **Mystery Box Reveals**: ON - Who is Father? What's the nationwide circle? What's in the Fifth Laboratory? Mysteries seeded early, answered satisfyingly. No red herrings - clues are genuine foreshadowing
11. **Unreliable Narrator**: OFF - Straightforward POV. Closest: Al questioning if memories are real (episode ~40s) but revealed as paranoia, not narrative trick. Trust what you see
12. **Existential Philosophy**: ON - Equivalent Exchange as life philosophy (what's fair? what's sacrifice worth?), Truth's lessons (knowledge requires price, hubris punished), human vs homunculus (what makes humanity valuable? souls? growth? mortality?), Hohenheim's immortality curse (long life≠happiness)
13. **Rule of Cool**: MODIFIED - Cool moments earn setup (Mustang's flame choreography is strategic AND stylish, Ed's alchemy creativity is logical AND flashy). Not "logic irrelevant for awesome" (Gurren Lagann) but "logic enables awesome" (Armstrong's sparkles are joke BUT his alchemy is sound)
14. **Mundane Made Epic**: ON - Alchemy is SCIENCE (transmutation circles are chemistry/physics equations), political coup grounded in military logistics, philosopher's stone creation is horrifying chemistry (souls→condensed energy). Elevates procedural (investigation, espionage, politics) to epic stakes
15. **Tragic Hero Cycle**: ON - Ed starts arrogant (human transmutation hubris) → fails catastrophically (loses limbs, Al's body, Nina) → humbled → grows (learns alchemy isn't omnipotent, bonds matter more than knowledge) → ultimate sacrifice (gives alchemy itself, his identity/talent, to save Al). Mustang's cycle: ambition → Ishval war crimes → guilt → coup attempt → blindness → redemption. Hohenheim: created Father → 400 years guilt → atonement → death

## Pacing Rhythm

**Scene Length**: Moderate (3-8 minute scenes) - Battles can span episodes (Promised Day multi-episode climax), emotional beats given time (Hughes' funeral full scene, Ed's confession to Winry), investigations methodical (Mustang's team gathering evidence over multiple episodes)

**Arc Length**: 
- Mini-arcs: 3-6 episodes (Greed introduction/capture, Rush Valley, Briggs arc)
- Major arcs: 10-15 episodes (Ishval backstory scattered across series, Promised Day buildup + execution)
- Full series: 64 episodes = complete story, no sequel-baiting

**Filler Tolerance**: Minimal - Even comedy episodes advance plot (Yoki joins, Winry grows, culture-building for Xing/Resembool). ~5-10% "breathers" but all serve character/world

**Climax Frequency**: 
- Major climaxes: Every 10-15 episodes (Lab 5 reveal, Greed capture, Briggs battle, Promised Day)
- Minor climaxes: Every 2-4 episodes (philosophical realization, character death, battle victory/loss)

**Downtime Ratio**: 20-30% - Slice-of-life moments, travel montages, character bonding, political maneuvering between action arcs

---

## Tonal Signature

**Primary Emotions** (Top 5):
1. **Melancholic Determination** - Grief-driven purpose (Ed saving Al, Mustang's guilt-fueled reform, Scar's vengeance→redemption)
2. **Philosophical Contemplation** - What does Equivalent Exchange really mean? What's humanity worth?
3. **Righteous Anger** - Injustice (Ishval genocide, human experiments, Bradley's dictatorship) demands action
4. **Bittersweet Hope** - Darkness exists BUT change possible, sacrifice meaningful, bonds endure
5. **Tactical Tension** - Chess-match battles, political intrigue, counter-planning

**Violence Level**: Stylized-to-Graphic (6/10 scale)
- Alchemy battles are creative (impalement via transmuted spikes, incineration, dismemberment) but not gratuitous gore
- Ishval flashbacks show war crimes (charred bodies, child soldiers, PTSD) - graphic in implication not splatter
- Nina chimera is HORRIFYING body horror (psychological more than visual)
- Homunculi deaths are brutal (Lust incinerated repeatedly, Envy's true form reveal, Gluttony eaten by Pride)
- NOT censored (people die on-screen, blood shown) but not torture-porn

**Fanservice Level**: Minimal-to-None
- No sexualization (Winry/Hawkeye/Mei are characters not objects)
- Armstrong shirtless flexing is JOKE not titillation
- Romance is wholesome (Ed/Winry, Mustang/Hawkeye unrequited professionalism)

**Horror Elements**: Psychological + Body Horror
- Nina chimera (daddy+dog fusion, child's voice begging) - iconic trauma
- Human transmutation Truth scenes (body horror, limb loss, existential void)
- Philosopher's Stone creation (screaming souls, mass human sacrifice)
- Envy's true form (grotesque mass of faces)
- NOT jump-scares - slow dread, moral horror, existential unease

**Optimism Baseline**: Melancholic-to-Hopeful (4/10 scale)
- Journey is HARD (death, trauma, sacrifice, war crimes)
- Ending is EARNED hope (not naive, not guaranteed, but believed-in)
- Message: World is cruel AND kind, equivalent exchange is faith not law, bonds transcend math

---

## Dialogue Style

**Formality**: Context-Dependent
- Military scenes: Formal ranks, chain-of-command (Mustang's team addresses him as Colonel, Bradley as Fuhrer)
- Brothers/friends: Casual Japanese (Ed's rough speech, Al's polite, Armstrong's bombastic)
- Philosophical: Elevated (Truth speaks in riddles, Father's grandiose proclamations, Hohenheim's weary wisdom)

**Exposition Method**: Show-AND-Tell (Lecture-Medium)
- Alchemy EXPLAINED via Ed's teaching (to Winry, to Al, to audience-proxy characters)
- Flashbacks SHOW Ishval (don't just talk about war crimes, depict them)
- Political intrigue shown (Mustang's team investigating) AND discussed (strategy meetings)
- Balance: Not Monogatari word-walls (10) but not pure visual storytelling (Mushishi 2). Trusts audience to follow complex explanations

**Banter Frequency**: Moderate
- Ed/Al brotherly teasing (short jokes, philosopher's stone arguments, nostalgic childhood references)
- Mustang/Hawkeye professional sniping (she threatens to shoot him, he flirts ineffectually, both ultra-competent)
- Armstrong family absurdity (sparkles, flexing, GENETICS)
- NOT constant (Konosuba level) - banter punctuates serious scenes, doesn't replace them

**Dramatic Declarations**: ON
- "A lesson without pain is meaningless!" (Ed's mantra)
- Alchemy technique names (Flame Alchemy, Destruction Alchemy, Alkahestry)
- "Stand up and walk. Keep moving forward." (Trisha's words)
- "I'm a terrible person. I'm going to keep killing." → "But I want to protect you." (Roy's duality)
- NOT every attack (not shonen attack-name spam) but key moments, emotional beats, philosophy

**Philosophical Debates Mid-Combat**: ON
- Ed vs Greed on humanity/desire
- Mustang vs Envy on Ishval guilt
- Father vs Hohenheim on godhood/humanity
- Scar vs Winry on revenge/forgiveness
- Fights PAUSE for ideological confrontation then RESUME

**Awkward Comedy**: ON (sparse)
- Ed's short-complex meltdowns (CHIBI RAGE)
- Havoc's romantic failures (shot down by every woman)
- Al's helmet-head disadvantages (cat climbs in, can't eat, intimidates children)
- Armstrong's enthusiasm misreading rooms (flexes during serious moments)

---

## Combat Narrative Style

**Strategy vs Spectacle**: 8/10 (Strategy-Heavy)
- Every fight is PUZZLE - opponent's weakness? environment advantages? alchemy counter?
- Mustang vs Lust: Waterline trap + confined space + exhaustion strategy
- Ed vs Pride/Kimblee: Use philosopher's stone radiation against them, transmute without circles innovation
- Promised Day: Multi-front coordination, contingency plans, sacrifice gambits
- Spectacle exists (Mustang's flame choreography, Armstrong's muscle alchemy, Father absorbing God) but SERVES strategy, not replaces it

**Power Explanations**: Exhaustive (9/10)
- Alchemy: Matter conservation, equivalent exchange, energy sources, circles as equations
- Homunculi: Philosopher's stone cores, regeneration limits, unique powers (Greed's Ultimate Shield carbon rearrangement, Envy's shapeshifting mass manipulation)
- Automail: Neural integration, maintenance needs, combat advantages (Ed's blade arm)
- Alkahestry: Different energy flow (dragon's pulse vs tectonic), healing focus vs transmutation
- SHOW formulas (circles drawn on-screen, equations explained), don't just say "it's magic"

**Sakuga Moments**: YES (Strategic Sakuga)
- Mustang's flame alchemy finger-snaps (dramatic AND explained: precise oxygen compression→spark ignition)
- Ed's rapid transmutation sequences (creativity showcase: spear→sword→shield→cannon in seconds)
- Father absorbing Truth/God (cosmic scale, philosophical weight)
- Scar's deconstruction arm (right arm destroys, left arm reconstructs via brother's research)
- Animation ELEVATES strategy - beautiful because it's smart AND stylish

**Named Attacks**: Moderate
- Flame Alchemy, Destruction Alchemy, Alkahestry techniques named
- Homunculi powers named (Ultimate Shield, Ultimate Eye)
- NOT every punch (contrast: shonen attack-name spam)
- Names convey WHAT POWER IS (descriptive) not just cool-sounding (Bankai equivalent but grounded)

**Environmental Destruction Scale**: Moderate-to-High
- City blocks damaged (Bradley vs Greed pub destruction, Central HQ battle)
- Promised Day craters landscape (Father's transmutation, multiple alchemists terraforming)
- NOT planet-busting (DBZ scale) but significant collateral
- Consequences shown (civilians evacuated, infrastructure repairs, political fallout)

## Example Scenes

### Example 1: Combat (Strategy + Philosophy)

```
CONTEXT: Ed faces Scar, who hunts State Alchemists for Ishval genocide revenge.

Ed: "You keep destroying without creating anything! That's not alchemy - 
that's just murder!"

Scar: "Your 'alchemy' destroyed my people. Equivalent exchange, State Alchemist."

*Scar's right arm glows - deconstruction alchemy. Ed dodges, transmutes ground 
into wall. Scar's arm SHATTERS it. Ed rolls, analyzes.*

Ed (internal): "His right arm only destroys... meaning he can't reconstruct. 
If I force close combat—"

*Ed transmutes arm into blade, lunges. Scar blocks with LEFT arm - regenerates 
damage via alkahestry. Ed's eyes widen.*

Ed: "Two types of alchemy?! That's—"

Scar: "My brother's research. Irony, yes? Ishvalan science, used for revenge 
against Amestris."

*Scar grabs Ed's blade-arm. Deconstruction glow spreads. Ed SCREAMS, transmutes 
blade back to metal arm - saves limb but loses balance. Scar pins him, right 
arm raised for killing blow.*

Scar: "Any last words, dog of the military?"

Ed: "Yeah. I'm sorry."

*Scar freezes. Ed doesn't beg - states fact, exhausted.*

Ed: "For Ishval. For your people. I wasn't there, but I wear this uniform. 
I'm sorry. Doesn't fix anything. Doesn't excuse it. But... I'm sorry."

*Scar's hand trembles. Memories flash - brother's dying words: 'Don't let 
revenge consume you.' Winry's parents healing Ishvalans. Rockbells' kindness.*

Scar (internal): "This boy... admits guilt without justification. Equivalent 
exchange?"

*Scar releases Ed, steps back.*

Scar: "You live. For now. But State Alchemists WILL answer for Ishval."

*Scar vanishes. Ed collapses, breathing hard. Al runs over.*

Al: "Brother! Why did you apologize?!"

Ed: "Because it's TRUE, Al. We can't fix the past. But we can... acknowledge it."

*Camera pulls back. Rain begins. Equivalent exchange - words for life.*
```

**WHY THIS WORKS**:
- Combat is TACTICAL (Ed analyzes Scar's dual-arm alchemy, adapts strategy)
- Philosophy INTEGRATED (destruction vs creation, revenge vs forgiveness, guilt acknowledgment)
- Emotional weight (Ed's apology isn't weakness - it's growth from Nina's trauma)
- Consequence-driven (Scar spares him, setting up future alliance)
- Pacing: Action → Pause → Philosophy → Action → Resolution (not pure fight nor pure talk)

---

### Example 2: Dialogue (Character Development + Worldbuilding)

```
CONTEXT: Mustang's office. Late night. Hawkeye cleaning rifle. Mustang reviewing Ishval files.

Mustang: "Riza."

Hawkeye: "Sir."

Mustang: "Do you think... if I become Fuhrer... it'll balance the scales? 
All those lives in Ishval... can my reforms—"

Hawkeye: "No."

*Mustang looks up, startled by bluntness.*

Hawkeye: "You can't bring them back. You can't erase what we did. Equivalent 
exchange doesn't work that way, Colonel."

Mustang (bitter): "Then what's the point? Why am I—"

Hawkeye: "Because the living deserve better. The children who survived Ishval 
deserve a country that won't repeat that mistake. Equivalent exchange isn't 
math, sir. It's... faith."

*Mustang stares. Hawkeye continues, assembling rifle with practiced ease.*

Hawkeye: "My father believed alchemy could save lives. He was wrong - it 
killed him, scarred me, became a weapon. But YOU, sir, you want to use 
power to PREVENT another Ishval. That's not equivalent. That's... hope."

Mustang: "Hope? From the woman who threatened to shoot me if I strayed?"

Hawkeye (small smile): "I'll still shoot you. But I believe you'll earn that 
bullet trying to do good, not becoming another Bradley."

*Silence. Mustang returns to files, less hunched.*

Mustang: "When I'm Fuhrer... first act will be putting Ishval war criminals 
on trial. Starting with myself."

Hawkeye: "I'll testify beside you. Sir."

Mustang: "Dismissed, Lieutenant. Get some sleep."

Hawkeye: "You first, Colonel."

*Neither moves. Both keep working. Rain on windows. Quiet companionship of 
shared guilt, shared purpose.*
```

**WHY THIS WORKS**:
- Equivalent Exchange philosophy EXPLORED (not just stated)
- Character depth (Mustang's guilt, Hawkeye's pragmatic faith, mutual trust)
- Worldbuilding (Ishval's ongoing impact, military structure, reform politics)
- Relationship dynamics (professional yet intimate, she threatens him WITH CARE)
- Dialogue reveals character (Mustang self-flagellating, Hawkeye grounding him, both workaholics)
- Pacing: Slow, contemplative - matches late-night introspection tone

---

### Example 3: Exploration/Discovery (Mystery + Horror)

```
CONTEXT: Elric brothers investigate Lab 5 rumors (human experimentation).

Ed: "Smells like... copper. And decay."

Al: "Brother, maybe we should report this to—"

Ed: "To who? The military RUNS this place. We need proof first."

*Descend stairs. Darkness. Ed transmutes torch - stone glows via phosphorus 
reaction. Reveals MASSIVE chamber. Hundreds of containment tubes. Each holds... 
a human body. Some moving.*

Al: "Oh... oh no..."

*Ed approaches closest tube. Man inside, eyes wide, mouthing HELP. Veins glow 
red - philosopher's stone corruption spreading.*

Ed (reading plaque): "Subject 66-A. Sentenced: Murder. Status: Transmutation 
in progress. Viability... 34%?"

*Another tube SHATTERS. Amorphous flesh-thing spills out, SCREAMING. Ed and 
Al jump back. It writhes - too many limbs, faces bubbling on surface.*

Voice (echoing): "Ah, visitors. How rare."

*Figure emerges from shadows. Lab coat. Glasses. Smiling.*

Tucker: "Hello, Edward. Alphonse. Admiring my work?"

Ed (horror): "Tucker?! You're supposed to be EXECUTED for Nina—"

Tucker: "Death row inmates make excellent research material. The military 
agreed. Philosopher's stones require human souls, yes? Why waste prisoners?"

*Al steps forward, fists clenched.*

Al: "These are PEOPLE! Even if they're criminals—"

Tucker: "They're components. Nina understood. She became something greater. 
These subjects will too. Eventually."

*Ed's alchemy crackles - rage barely contained.*

Ed: "You're insane. I'm shutting this down."

Tucker (still smiling): "Are you? Even if it means the military's philosopher's 
stone research ends? Even if it means you can't restore Alphonse's body? 
Equivalent exchange, Edward. Sacrifice a few... or lose your brother forever."

*Ed freezes. The trolley problem made flesh. Al's helmet turns toward him.*

Al: "Brother... don't. Don't even THINK it."

Ed (shaking): "I... I know, Al. I KNOW."

*Transmutes ground - stone spears impale Tucker's legs. Non-lethal but 
incapacitating.*

Ed: "We'll find ANOTHER way. One that doesn't..."

*Looks at writhing flesh-thing. At tubes of suffering prisoners. At Tucker's 
knowing smile.*

Ed: "...We're getting you all out. Then burning this place down."

Tucker (laughing): "And when the military asks what you found? When your 
superiors demand silence? What then, State Alchemist?"

*Ed and Al exchange looks. The conspiracy goes DEEPER than they thought. 
They're complicit by uniform.*

Ed (quiet): "Then we climb the ladder. Find who's responsible. And make them 
answer for THIS."

*Alarms blare. Guards approaching. The brothers run, carrying what evidence 
they can. Behind them, Tucker's laughter echoes. The flesh-thing's screams 
fade.*

Al: "Brother... we're fighting our own country, aren't we?"

Ed: "Yeah. Looks like."

*Grim determination. The lab burns - evidence destroyed, prisoners 'accidentally' 
killed in fire per official report. Ed knows the truth now. Military is 
rotten. And he's inside it.*
```

**WHY THIS WORKS**:
- Mystery deepens (military conspiracy, philosopher's stone human cost)
- Horror visceral (body horror, moral horror, Nina callback)
- Character growth (Ed chooses morality over pragmatism, accepts harder path)
- Worldbuilding (military corruption depth, state alchemy's dark side)
- Stakes raised (brothers now vs their own institution)
- Exploration isn't just "find treasure" - it's "discover awful truth, can't unknow it"
- Pacing: Slow dread buildup → shocking reveal → moral dilemma → action escape

## Adjustment Log

**Session 1** (Hypothetical): N/A - New profile, no player adjustments yet

**Future Adjustments**:
- If player wants MORE comedy: Increase Armstrong family appearances, add chibi moments during tension, lean into Ed's short-complex
- If player wants DARKER: Emphasize Ishval genocide horror, remove comedy relief, lean into Lab 5 body horror, make consequences permanent (character deaths stick)
- If player wants LESS philosophy: Cut mid-combat debates, make alchemy more instinctive/less explained, focus action over introspection
- If player wants FASTER pace: Condense investigation arcs, jump to climaxes, reduce downtime episodes

## Usage Notes

### When to Use This Profile

**Perfect for**:
- Players who want **smart protagonists** (strategy > raw power)
- Campaigns focused on **moral complexity** (no easy right answers)
- Groups interested in **hard magic systems** (rules-based alchemy/powers with costs)
- Stories about **redemption and consequences** (past mistakes haunt, growth possible but hard-earned)
- Political intrigue + military drama + action blend
- **Philosophical themes** (equivalent exchange as life metaphor, cost of knowledge, humanity's value)

**NOT ideal for**:
- Pure power fantasy (protagonists struggle, earn wins)
- Simple good-vs-evil (morality is grey, military protagonists commit war crimes)
- Fast-paced non-stop action (includes investigation, politics, character development)
- Players uncomfortable with body horror (Nina chimera, philosopher's stone creation, Truth scenes)
- Groups wanting pure comedy or pure darkness (FMAB balances both)

### Calibration Tips

1. **Alchemy System Design**: Establish RULES early (equivalent exchange, energy source, taboos). Make players track resources if using alchemy (materials, energy, preparation time). Every transmutation has COST - flashy moves drain stamina/materials.

2. **Moral Complexity**: Present trolley problems (save many vs save few, reform from inside vs burn system down, justice vs mercy). Don't validate player's choice as "correct" - show consequences of BOTH paths. NPCs disagree on morality.

3. **Tactical Combat**: Enemies should have WEAKNESSES players discover (Mustang useless in rain, automail vulnerable to cold, alchemy requires circles). Encourage environment use, preparation, creativity. Reward OUT-THINKING not out-powering.

4. **Equivalent Exchange Philosophy**: Apply consistently - shortcuts have hidden costs, sacrifices yield rewards, bonds are reciprocal. If player hoards (doesn't give), world hoards back. If player gives freely (helps NPCs, sacrifices for others), support returns unexpectedly.

5. **Tone Balance**: Alternate heavy episodes (genocide flashback, character death, body horror) with light episodes (comedy relief, slice-of-life, romance progress). Never undercut DURING tragic moment but provide breathers AFTER.

6. **Mystery Pacing**: Seed clues early (homunculi sightings, nationwide transmutation circle hints, military inconsistencies). Players should theorize, investigate, discover. Reveals should feel earned not arbitrary.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **WRONG**: Making alchemy limitless magic (transmute anything anytime)  
✅ **RIGHT**: Alchemy has COSTS (materials needed, energy source, equivalent exchange limits, preparation time, taboos like human transmutation)

❌ **WRONG**: Clear heroes vs villains (military good, homunculi evil)  
✅ **RIGHT**: Military committed genocide (Ishval), homunculi have understandable motives (Greed wants freedom, Envy wants belonging), morality is grey

❌ **WRONG**: Power-of-friendship instant wins  
✅ **RIGHT**: Bonds enable STRATEGY (coordinated tactics, trust-based plans, sacrifice for each other) but not power-ups. Victories require planning + sacrifice

❌ **WRONG**: Ignoring trauma (Nina's death forgotten after arc)  
✅ **RIGHT**: Trauma LINGERS (Ed visits Nina's grave, Ishval veterans have PTSD, Hughes' death affects Mustang for entire series)

❌ **WRONG**: Explaining everything instantly  
✅ **RIGHT**: Let players DISCOVER lore (research alchemy, investigate conspiracy, earn reveals). Mystery sustains engagement

❌ **WRONG**: Grimdark misery (everyone dies, nothing matters)  
✅ **RIGHT**: Dark journey, HOPEFUL ending. Sacrifices are meaningful, redemption possible, bonds transcend equivalent exchange math
