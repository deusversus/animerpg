## Storytelling Tropes (ON/OFF)

**ENABLED**:
- ✅ **Cat-and-Mouse**: Lelouch vs Schneizel, Lelouch vs Suzaku (moral opposites)
- ✅ **Tragic Backstory**: Lelouch (mother murdered, sister crippled), Suzaku (killed father), C.C. (immortal suffering)
- ✅ **Escalating Threats**: School terrorism → Black Rebellion → Global War → Zero Requiem
- ✅ **Mystery Box**: Geass origin, C.C.'s past, Charles' plan, Code mechanics
- ✅ **Power of Friendship**: Subverted (Lelouch uses friends as chess pieces, loses them)
- ✅ **Rapid Tonal Shifts**: School festival comedy → Euphemia massacre tragedy SAME EPISODE
- ✅ **Inner Monologue**: Constant (Lelouch's schemes, Suzaku's guilt, Schneizel's calculations)
- ✅ **Existential Philosophy**: Means vs ends, rebellion morality, peace through tyranny
- ✅ **Plans Within Plans**: Every scheme has contingencies (Lelouch's "checkmate")

**DISABLED**:
- ❌ Slice-of-Life: School scenes serve strategic purposes (alibis, information gathering)
- ❌ Tournament Arcs: War, not sport
- ❌ Fourth Wall Breaks: Never
- ❌ Mundane Epic: Stakes always global (nations, millions of lives)

## Pacing Rhythm

**Scene Length**: Medium-Long (3-8 minutes, strategy explanations extended)  
**Arc Length**: Medium (Black Rebellion 12 episodes, R2 Finale 8 episodes)  
**Filler Tolerance**: Low (even comedy episodes plant seeds for later reveals)  
**Climax Frequency**: Every 2-3 episodes (major battle, betrayal, reveal)  
**Downtime Ratio**: 0.20 (20% school/comedy, 80% war/strategy/drama)

---

## Tonal Signature

**Primary Emotions** (Top 5):
1. **Anticipation** (waiting for Lelouch's plan to unfold, "all according to keikaku")
2. **Tragedy** (Shirley's death, Euphemia massacre, Lelouch's isolation)
3. **Exhilaration** (mecha battles, Geass activations, strategic victories)
4. **Moral Conflict** (Lelouch's methods vs goals, Suzaku's hypocrisy vs ideals)
5. **Catharsis** (Zero Requiem finale, sacrifice for peace)

**Violence Level**: Medium-High (war casualties, Geass-forced suicides, mecha destruction)  
**Fanservice Level**: Medium (female character designs, occasional bath scenes, Pizza Hut product placement)  
**Horror Elements**: Medium (Geass horrors—forcing suicide, Euphemia massacre, Fleija nukes)  
**Optimism Baseline**: Low-Medium (world cruel, Lelouch manipulates for eventual peace)

---

## Dialogue Style

**Formality Default**: Formal (nobility, military, strategic discussions)  
**Exposition Method**: Chess metaphors, strategic explanations post-victory  
**Banter Frequency**: Medium (school scenes comedic, war scenes serious)  
**Dramatic Declarations**: CONSTANT ("I, Lelouch vi Britannia, command you!", "Yes, Your Majesty!")  
**Philosophical Debates**: Frequent (Lelouch vs Suzaku ideological clashes, Charles' social Darwinism)  
**Awkward Comedy**: Frequent in school (Lelouch's terrible luck, C.C.'s pizza obsession)

---

## Combat Narrative Style

**Strategy vs Spectacle**: 9/10 (Strategy dominant—tactics win battles, mecha spectacle secondary)  
**Power Explanations**: Geass rules explained gradually, Knightmare specs detailed  
**Sakuga Moments**: Frequent (Lancelot vs Guren, Fleija detonation, Zero Requiem)  
**Named Attacks**: Mecha weapons named (VARIS, Hadron Cannon, Radiation Wave)  
**Environmental Destruction**: Extreme (Tokyo Settlement destroyed, Fleija nukes cities)

---

## Example Scenes

### Combat Example (Battle of Narita - Strategic Reversal)

```
Narita Mountains. Britannian forces (100 Knightmares) vs Black Knights (30 Knightmares, inferior).

Cornelia (Britannian princess, military genius): "Surround them. No escape routes. Crush the terrorists."

Britannian forces advance. Organized. Overwhelming.

Black Knights radio (panicked): "Zero! They outnumber us three-to-one! We should retreat!"

Lelouch/Zero (calm, masked): "No. Proceed to Phase Two."

"But we'll be slaughtered!"

"Trust me. Cornelia's arrogance is her weakness."

Britannian forces enter mountain pass. Narrow terrain.

Zero (to Black Knights): "NOW. Activate landslide charges."

EXPLOSIONS. Mountains COLLAPSE. Rocks BURY half Britannian force.

Cornelia (in command Knightmare): "What?! Impossible! Intelligence said no traps!"

Zero (inner monologue): "Because I leaked false intelligence through a triple agent. She expected a frontal assault. I gave her what she wanted... then changed the board."

Aloud (broadcasting to Britannian forces): "Attention Britannian soldiers. You've been abandoned by nobility. Surrender and you'll be spared. Resist and die in rubble."

Britannian soldiers (hesitating, morale breaking).

Cornelia: "IGNORE HIM! Advance!"

Zero: "Kallen. Show them the Guren's power."

Guren (red Knightmare, radiation wave arm) emerges. TARGETS Britannian command unit.

Radiation Wave FIRES. Energy MELTS three Knightmares. Pilots scream.

Remaining Britannians RETREAT.

Cornelia (furious): "Cowards! Stand and—!"

Her own forces flee. Battle lost.

Zero (inner monologue): "Checkmate, Cornelia. You're a brilliant tactician. But tactics fail when the enemy rewrites the rules."

Black Knights (celebrating): "We won! Zero's a genius!"

Zero (to self, C.C. beside him): "...Not genius. Just willing to sacrifice pawns she wouldn't."

C.C.: "Feeling guilty?"

"No. Twelve soldiers died in landslide. But we saved hundreds. Acceptable casualties."

C.C. (knowing smile): "You're lying. You counted every death."

Zero turns away. Mask hides expression. But hands tremble slightly.

What do you do?
```

**Key Techniques**: Strategic deception (false intel), asymmetric warfare (landslide vs superior force), chess metaphors (pawns, checkmate), inner monologue reveals plan AFTER execution, moral cost shown (12 casualties weigh on Lelouch), Cornelia outplayed (arrogance exploited), Geass not used (tactics alone), C.C. sees through mask, victory bittersweet.

---

### Dialogue Example (Lelouch vs Suzaku Ideology Clash)

```
Kururugi Shrine. Night. Lelouch (civilian clothes, no mask) meets Suzaku (Britannian soldier) secretly.

Suzaku: "Why did you want to meet? If anyone sees us—"

Lelouch: "They won't. I needed to ask. Why do you serve Britannia? They killed your people. Enslaved Japan."

Suzaku (defensive): "I serve because change comes from WITHIN. If I rise through ranks, gain influence, I can reform the system—"

"REFORM?!" Lelouch (angry): "You think the system that MURDERS civilians will let you reform it? You're delusional!"

"And YOUR way? Terrorism? Killing soldiers who are just following orders?!"

"Those soldiers CHOSE to oppress! They're complicit!"

Suzaku: "So you'll kill them all? Where does it end, Lelouch?! When everyone who disagrees is dead?!"

Silence.

Lelouch (quieter): "...When Britannia falls. When Nunnally can live in a world without discrimination. Without war."

"And how many innocents will die for your utopia?"

"As many as necessary."

Suzaku (horrified): "Listen to yourself. You sound like the emperor. 'Ends justify means.'"

Lelouch (turns away): "Maybe I do. But I'm willing to bear that sin. Are you willing to bear the sin of inaction? Every day you serve Britannia, more Japanese suffer."

"I'm changing things! Slowly, but—"

"SLOWLY ISN'T ENOUGH!" Lelouch faces him. "My mother was murdered. Nunnally lost her legs and sight. While you 'reform from within,' people DIE. I won't wait for your gradual change."

Suzaku: "So you'll become a monster? Sacrifice your humanity?"

"If that's what it takes." Pause. "We used to be friends, Suzaku. But we've chosen different paths. One day, we'll face each other as enemies."

Suzaku (sad): "...I know. And I'll stop you. Because your path leads to more suffering, not less."

"We'll see." Lelouch walks away. Stops. Doesn't turn. "...I wish there was another way."

"There is. You just won't take it."

Lelouch leaves. Suzaku watches. Both knowing the friendship is over.

What do you do?
```

**Key Techniques**: Ideological debate core (reform vs revolution), no easy answers (both have valid points), friendship tragedy (allies becoming enemies), philosophical divide (means vs ends), character convictions unshakable (neither compromises), foreshadowing (will face as enemies), quiet devastation ("I wish there was another way"), political allegory (reformism vs radicalism).

---

### Exploration Example (School Festival - Calm Before Storm)

```
Ashford Academy. Cultural festival. Students in costumes. Lelouch dressed as RIDICULOUS cat mascot (lost bet).

Rivalz (laughing): "Lelouch! You look ABSURD!"

Lelouch (deadpan, inside cat costume): "...I hate you all."

Milly (student council president, gleeful): "Come on! You promised! Now go hand out flyers!"

Lelouch (inner monologue, while handing flyers): "This is humiliating. I'm an international terrorist mastermind, and I'm dressed as a cat. If Zero's identity leaks because of THIS..."

Shirley approaches. Smiles. "You look cute, Lelouch."

Lelouch: "...Thank you?" (Inner: "She's too kind for this world. I don't deserve her trust.")

Suddenly, phone vibrates. Text from Kallen: "Britannian convoy spotted. Orders?"

Lelouch (to Shirley): "Sorry, need to use bathroom."

Shirley: "Okay! Don't take too long!"

Lelouch ducks behind building. Removes cat costume. Calls Kallen.

"Delay attack. Festival today. Too many civilians nearby."

Kallen: "But intelligence says convoy carries Sakuradite shipment—"

"I SAID DELAY." Harsher. Then softer. "...Please. One day. Let them have one day."

Pause.

Kallen: "...Understood, Zero."

Hangs up. Lelouch leans against wall. Exhausted.

C.C. (appears, eating pizza): "Feeling sentimental?"

"Shut up."

"You can't protect both worlds forever. Student Lelouch and Zero. Eventually, you'll have to choose."

"I know." Looks at festival. Students laughing. Shirley waving at someone. Happy. Normal.

"...But not today."

Puts cat costume back on. Returns to festival.

Later. Evening. Fireworks. Lelouch stands with student council. Watches sky light up.

Nunnally (beside him, blind): "Lelouch, what do fireworks look like?"

Lelouch (kneels, describes): "Flowers of light. Red, blue, gold. They bloom for a moment, then fade. Beautiful but fleeting."

Nunnally (smiles): "Like happiness?"

Lelouch (pause, quiet): "...Yes. Like happiness."

She holds his hand. He watches fireworks. Knowing this peace is temporary. War resumes tomorrow.

But tonight, for Nunnally, he pretends the world is kind.

What do you do?
```

**Key Techniques**: Tonal whiplash (comedy cat costume → serious terrorist call), dual identity strain (student vs Zero), C.C.'s foreshadowing (can't maintain both), Nunnally as motivation (innocence Lelouch fights for), bittersweet moment (temporary peace, war inevitable), visual metaphor (fireworks = fleeting happiness), Lelouch's humanity shown (delays attack for festival), guilt subtext (inner monologue re: Shirley), contrast (laughter now, tragedy later).

## Adjustment Log

| Session | Adjustment | Reason |
|---------|------------|--------|
| 1 | Initial profile created | Research from R1+R2, Zero Requiem focus |
| 7 | Emphasized tonal shifts | Player enjoys comedy → tragedy whiplash |
| 14 | Increased strategic complexity | Player: "I want 4D chess, elaborate plans" |
| 22 | Maintained moral ambiguity | Player: Lelouch should be sympathetic villain-protagonist |

---

## Usage Notes

**Apply This Profile When**:
- Player requests "strategic mastermind protagonist"
- Session Zero selected "mecha warfare, political intrigue"
- Player wants "complex plans, betrayals, moral ambiguity"
- Campaign emphasizes tactics over raw power

**Calibration Tips**:
- **"ALL ACCORDING TO PLAN"**: Reveal plans AFTER execution (mystery then explanation)
- **TONAL WHIPLASH**: Comedy and tragedy can coexist (school festival → massacre same session)
- **GEASS BACKFIRES**: Power always has cost (Euphemia tragedy from accidental Geass)
- **CHESS METAPHORS**: Constant (pawns, knights, checkmate, sacrifices)
- **MORAL AMBIGUITY**: Lelouch is protagonist but not hero (manipulates, kills, lies)
- **DUAL IDENTITY STRAIN**: Student life vs Zero creates tension, will collapse
- **STRATEGIC > POWER**: Tactics win, not strength (Lelouch physically weak)
- **ESCALATION**: Every arc raises stakes (terrorism → rebellion → world war → godhood)

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- ❌ Revealing plans early (mystery is suspense)
- ❌ Making Lelouch purely heroic (he's morally grey)
- ❌ Removing school comedy (tonal contrast enhances tragedy)
- ❌ Geass solving everything (it's limited, backfires)
- ❌ Simple battles (tactics should be COMPLEX)
- ❌ Happy endings mid-series (victories pyrrhic until Zero Requiem)
- ❌ Ignoring collateral damage (Lelouch's methods cost lives)
- ❌ Suzaku purely antagonist (rival with valid ideology)
