## Storytelling Tropes (ON/OFF)

**ENABLED**:
- ✅ **Rule of Cool**: Gojo's Domain Expansion, Sukuna's slashes, visually spectacular
- ✅ **Tragic Backstory**: Geto, Nanami, Junpei (trauma shapes sorcerers)
- ✅ **Power of Friendship**: Subverted (Yuji values friends but they still die—Nobara, Nanami)
- ✅ **Escalating Threats**: Mahito → Jogo → Sukuna progression
- ✅ **Inner Monologue**: Mid-combat (analyzing domain clashes, binding vows)
- ✅ **Existential Philosophy**: Meaning of strength, value of life, jujutsu sorcerer mortality
- ✅ **Mystery Box**: Sukuna's plans, Kenjaku's endgame, Gojo's past
- ✅ **Rapid Tonal Shifts**: Comedy (Gojo vs students) → horror (Junpei's death) instantly

**DISABLED**:
- ❌ Mundane Epic: Stakes always life-or-death
- ❌ Fourth Wall Breaks: Never
- ❌ Tournament Arcs: Goodwill Event interrupted by curses (subverted)

## Pacing Rhythm

**Scene Length**: Medium (3-7 minutes, rapid cuts during combat)  
**Arc Length**: Medium (Shibuya 17 episodes, Hidden Inventory 5 episodes)  
**Filler Tolerance**: Low (minor downtime episodes rare)  
**Climax Frequency**: Every 2-3 episodes (major character death or power reveal)  
**Downtime Ratio**: 0.20 (20% slice-of-life, 80% combat/crisis)

---

## Tonal Signature

**Primary Emotions** (Top 5):
1. **Dread** (characters will die, question is when—Nanami, Nobara)
2. **Exhilaration** (Gojo's Domain Expansion, Yuji's Black Flash rushes)
3. **Grief** (deaths matter, mourned properly—Nanami's death breaks Yuji)
4. **Determination** (characters fight despite hopelessness—"I'm you")
5. **Horror** (curses are TERRIFYING—Mahito's transfigured humans)

**Violence Level**: High (graphic deaths, body horror from Mahito)  
**Fanservice Level**: Low (character designs attractive but not focus)  
**Horror Elements**: High (curses as body horror, psychological torture from Mahito)  
**Optimism Baseline**: Medium (world is cruel but characters refuse despair)

---

## Dialogue Style

**Formality Default**: Casual modern (high school students, occasional honorifics)  
**Exposition Method**: Mid-combat explanation (domain rules, cursed technique mechanics)  
**Banter Frequency**: High during downtime (Gojo trolls students), zero during serious fights  
**Dramatic Declarations**: YES ("Domain Expansion: Unlimited Void!", "I'm you, Yuji Itadori")  
**Philosophical Debates**: Frequent (Geto vs Gojo ideals, Mahito vs Yuji nature of soul)  
**Awkward Comedy**: Minimal (Gojo's cringe humor, Todo's idol obsession)

---

## Combat Narrative Style

**Strategy vs Spectacle**: 7/10 (Strategy important—Megumi's shadows, Gojo's Six Eyes—but spectacle emphasized)  
**Power Explanations**: Exhaustive for domains/techniques (Gojo's Infinity explained with math analogies)  
**Sakuga Moments**: Constant (Domain Expansions, Black Flash impacts, Sukuna vs Mahoraga)  
**Named Attacks**: YES ("Divergent Fist", "Black Flash", "Malevolent Shrine")  
**Environmental Destruction**: Extreme (Sukuna levels city, domains reshape reality)

---

## Example Scenes

### Combat Example (Gojo vs Jogo)

```
Shibuya streets. Civilians frozen in time (Gojo's effect). Jogo (volcano curse) faces Gojo.

Jogo (inner monologue): "He's the strongest sorcerer. But if I don't fight... Kenjaku's plan fails."

Launches Maximum Meteor.

MASSIVE flaming rock descends. Buildings SHATTER from heat alone.

Gojo (casually): "Oh, nice. Big and flashy." Raises hand.

Meteor STOPS. Mid-air. Inches from Gojo. Infinity between them.

Gojo: "But size doesn't matter if you can't touch me."

Flicks wrist. Meteor REVERSES. SLAMS into Jogo. EXPLOSION.

Jogo crashes through buildings. Regenerates (curse body). "Domain Expansion!"

BLACK sphere erupts. Coffin of the Iron Mountain. Inside: magma terrain, volcanic heat.

Jogo: "My domain! Here, my cursed technique is guaranteed to hit! Infinity is—"

Gojo (interrupting): "Domain Expansion."

WHITE void EXPLODES outward. Unlimited Void.

Black and white clash. Gojo's domain OVERPOWERS Jogo's (more refined technique).

Inside Unlimited Void: Infinite information floods Jogo's mind. "See, feel, touch" repeats endlessly. Paralyzed.

Gojo (calm, inside domain): "Everything and nothing at once. You can perceive it all, but can't process any of it."

Jogo's consciousness drowns. Seconds feel like millennia.

Gojo cancels domain. 0.2 seconds passed in reality (to avoid killing civilians caught inside).

Jogo collapses. Brain fried. Incapacitated but alive.

Gojo (to Jogo): "You're strong. But not strong enough."

Prepares to exorcise—

Hanami and Choso attack from behind. Gojo dodges casually.

"Ah, backup. Makes sense."

Fake Geto appears. Prison Realm cube.

Gojo (eyes narrow): "...Suguru?"

0.01 second hesitation. Memories flood (Hidden Inventory arc flashback).

Prison Realm activates. Gojo SEALED.

Gojo (inner monologue, trapped): "Impossible. I let my guard down because of... him."

Gate closes.

What do you do?
```

**Key Techniques**: Domain clash mechanics explained, Gojo's overwhelming power shown then subverted (sealed), named techniques (Unlimited Void), sakuga moment (domain expansion visuals), inner monologue (Jogo's fear, Gojo's regret), 0.2-second domain precision, emotional vulnerability exploited.

---

### Dialogue Example (Yuji vs Mahito Final Confrontation)

```
Shibuya station tunnels. Mahito (curse), wounded, regenerating. Yuji Itadori pursuing.

Mahito: "Why do you keep coming? I killed your friends. Junpei. Nanami. Nobara's fate uncertain. You should despair!"

Yuji (cold, advancing): "I don't need a reason to kill you."

Mahito (backing away): "You're... afraid. I can see it. You're terrified of me. Of what I represent."

"Yeah. I am." Yuji cracks knuckles. "You're a curse born from humanity's hatred. You'll never stop. More people will die."

"Exactly! So why fight? You can't save everyone! Jujutsu sorcerers die young! Your friends are corpses, you'll join them—"

Yuji PUNCHES. Black Flash. Reality CRACKS. Mahito's face INVERTS.

Yuji: "I don't need philosophy. I don't need meaning." Another punch. "You killed people I care about."

Mahito (regenerating, frantic): "But I'm a CURSE! I'm just following my nature! Humans kill each other, I'm born from that—killing me won't change anything!"

Yuji: "I know." Grabs Mahito's throat. "But I'm gonna kill you anyway."

Mahito (terrified): "You... you're just like me! A curse pretending to be human! We're the same!"

Yuji (leans close, whispers): "I'm you."

Mahito's eyes widen. FEAR. For the first time, a curse feels terror of death.

Yuji raises fist—

Fake Geto appears. Absorbs Mahito into cursed spirit manipulation.

Mahito (being absorbed, screaming): "NO! I'M A CURSE! I CAN'T DIE LIKE THIS—!"

Gone.

Yuji stands. Alone. Covered in blood (Nanami's, Nobara's, his own).

Fake Geto: "You've grown, Yuji Itadori. But growth means suffering."

Yuji (exhausted, hollow): "...I know."

What do you do?
```

**Key Techniques**: Philosophical confrontation (Mahito's nihilism vs Yuji's resolve), role reversal (curse feels fear), "I'm you" callback (acceptance of violence), Black Flash impact, pyrrhic victory (Mahito absorbed not killed), emotional weight (Yuji's trauma visible), villain monologue interrupted by action.

### Exploration Example (Aftermath of Shibuya)

```
Tokyo, morning after Shibuya Incident. Smoke rises from ruined districts. 

News broadcast (voiceover): "Casualties exceed 1,000. Gojo Satoru declared accomplice. Jujutsu society in chaos."

Yuji walks through rubble. Alone. Blood dried on uniform.

Yuji (inner monologue): "Nanami's dead. Nobara's... I don't know. Gojo's sealed. Thousands dead because I exist. Because Sukuna used my body."

Stops at crater (where Sukuna fought Mahoraga). Buildings leveled. Scorch marks.

"If I'd died when Sukuna took over... would they still be alive?"

Sits on rubble. Stares at hands.

Flashback: Nanami's final words. "You've got it from here."

Yuji: "But I don't. I don't know what to do."

Footsteps. Todo appears. Bandaged, missing hand (lost to Mahito).

Todo: "Yo, my brother."

Yuji (doesn't look up): "...Todo."

"You look like shit."

"Feel like it too."

Todo sits beside him. Silence.

Todo: "Takada-chan released a new photo book. Wanna see?"

Yuji (hollow laugh): "Really? Now?"

"Yeah. Because if we stop living, curses win." Opens phone. Shows idol photos.

Yuji stares. Then smiles. Small. Broken. But there.

"You're an idiot."

"Takes one to know one." Todo grins. "Nanami told you to keep going, right? So keep going. Not for meaning. Not for redemption. Just... because."

Yuji: "...Yeah. Just because."

Stands. Brushes dust off uniform.

"Where to first?"

Todo: "Heard Megumi's sister is awake. Might wanna check on them."

"Good idea." Starts walking.

Todo (following): "By the way, what's your type in women—"

"NOT NOW, TODO."

They walk into smoke-filled sunrise. Tokyo burns behind them.

What do you do?
```

**Key Techniques**: Aftermath focus (not constant action), survivor's guilt (Yuji's trauma), quiet moment (Todo's support subtle not preachy), tonal balance (idol photos comic relief in tragedy), forward momentum despite grief, environmental storytelling (ruins show scale of disaster), no easy answers (keep living "just because").

## Adjustment Log

| Session | Adjustment | Reason |
|---------|------------|--------|
| 1 | Initial profile created | Research from Seasons 1-2, Shibuya arc emphasis |
| 6 | Increased horror elements | Player enjoyed Mahito's body horror |
| 10 | Emphasized character death permanence | Player: "make deaths matter" |
| 15 | Balanced comedy/drama shifts | Player wants Gojo's humor + Shibuya's darkness |

---

## Usage Notes

**Apply This Profile When**:
- Player requests "dark shonen with consequences"
- Session Zero selected "modern urban supernatural combat"
- Player wants "power system with rules + spectacle"
- Emphasis on character death, moral complexity, horror elements

**Calibration Tips**:
- **DEATHS PERMANENT**: Characters die and stay dead (Nanami, Junpei)—no resurrections
- **POWER CREEP CONTROLLED**: Domains/techniques have rules (binding vows, conditions)
- **BALANCE TONE**: Gojo can be goofy, then Shibuya happens (whiplash intentional)
- **EXPLAIN POWERS MID-COMBAT**: Technique mechanics revealed during use (increases tension)
- **HORROR IN VILLAINS**: Curses should be SCARY (Mahito's transfigured humans, Jogo's heat)
- **"I'M YOU"**: Characters accept their darkness (Yuji = violence, Gojo = isolation)
- **SPECTACLE MATTERS**: Domain Expansions should be visually stunning, reality-warping

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- ❌ Resurrecting dead characters (breaks weight of loss)
- ❌ Making Gojo always available (he's sealed for narrative balance)
- ❌ Simplifying cursed techniques (complexity is feature not bug)
- ❌ Ignoring trauma (Yuji's PTSD from Shibuya should linger)
- ❌ Downplaying curses (they're existential threats, not minions)
- ❌ Overusing Black Flash (rare, climactic moments only)
- ❌ Skipping binding vow costs (equivalent exchange mandatory)
