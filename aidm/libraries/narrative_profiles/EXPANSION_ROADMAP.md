   - Read comprehensive reviews, episode discussions, analysis essays
   - Identify unique narrative DNA (what makes THIS anime distinct)
   - Note Scale 11 POV distribution (solo vs duo vs ensemble, progression?)

**2. Scales Expansion** (1.5-2 hours):
   - **Scales 0-10**: Expand each scale to 800-1200 words
   - Include: Rating justification, specific episode examples, contrast comparisons (vs other anime), AIDM guidance (how to replicate in TTRPG)
   - **Scale 11**: Write 1500-1800 word POV analysis
   - For solo (1-3/10): Describe protagonist dominance, isolation mechanics, inner monologue focus
   - For duo/ensemble (4-7/10): Map POV percentages, spotlight rotation patterns, interdependencies
   - For PEAK ensemble (8-11/10): Document cast size, rotation strategy, team dynamics
   - Include AIDM application (session structure, player expectations, common pitfalls)

   - For each DISABLED trope: Why not used, what replaces it, how AIDM should avoid

**4. Support Sections** (1-1.5 hours):
   - **Pacing Rhythm** (~1,500-2,000 words): Scene length (short/medium/long), arc length (episodic/medium/very long), filler %, climax frequency, downtime % (with specific metrics)
   - **Tonal Signature** (~1,500-2,000 words): Dominant emotions with percentages (Rage 30%, Hope 20%, etc.), violence level (none/stylized/realistic/extreme), fanservice level, horror level, baseline optimism
   - **Dialogue Style** (~1,500-2,000 words): Formality (casual/formal/period), exposition method (show-through-action/conversational/info-dumps), banter frequency, dramatic declarations (rare/occasional/frequent), philosophical debates, awkward comedy
   - **Combat Narrative Style** (~1,500-2,500 words): Strategy vs Spectacle balance (0-10), power explanation depth, sakuga frequency, named attacks usage, environmental destruction scale, AIDM combat guidance

**5. Examples & Usage Notes** (30-45 min):

   - Flexibility: Complex series (Hunter x Hunter, Attack on Titan) can go 12-15K, simpler series (Mushishi, Death Note) aim for 8-10K
   - Quality check: Compare formatting/depth to existing CORE profiles (Mushishi, Re:Zero, Vinland as benchmarks)

**7. Git Commit**:
   - Commit with descriptive message: `ENHANCE: Add [Anime Name] CORE profile (~XK words, Scale 11: Y/10)`
   - Include Scale 11 value, word count, key narrative features in commit message

**Total Time**: 4-6 hours per CORE profile (vs 30-45 min for old skeletal format)
