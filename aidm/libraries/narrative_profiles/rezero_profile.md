## Narrative Scales (0-10)

| Scale | Value | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **Introspection vs Action** | 8 | Heavy introspection (Subaru's trauma, self-loathing, growth) |
| **Comedy vs Drama** | 7 | Drama dominant but Subaru's otaku humor frequent |

## Storytelling Tropes (ON/OFF)

**ENABLED**:
- ✅ **Groundhog Day Loop**: Core mechanic (Return by Death, Subaru resets on death)
- ✅ **Tragic Backstory**: Subaru's NEET past, Rem/Ram's demon village, Emilia's persecution
- ✅ **Existential Philosophy**: Meaning of suffering, value of life, identity through pain
- ✅ **Mystery Box**: Witch's Cult motives, Satella's connection to Subaru, Roswaal's plans
- ✅ **Rapid Tonal Shifts**: Comedy (Subaru joking) → horror (brutal death) → despair
- ✅ **Inner Monologue**: Constant (Subaru's spiraling thoughts, self-hatred)
- ✅ **Escalating Threats**: White Whale → Sloth Archbishop → Greed Archbishop → Rabbits
- ✅ **Power of Friendship**: Earned painfully (Subaru earns trust through loops)

**DISABLED**:
- ❌ Rule of Cool: Deaths are UGLY, not glorious (intestines spilled, frozen solid, eaten alive)
- ❌ Power Fantasy: Subaru stays weak physically (mental strength only)
- ❌ Tournament Arcs: No competitions
- ❌ Mundane Epic: Stakes always life-or-death (entire timelines erased)
- ❌ Fourth Wall Breaks: Never (despite Subaru's otaku references)

---

## Pacing Rhythm

**Scene Length**: Long (10-15 minute sequences, especially death loops)  
**Arc Length**: Long (Mansion arc 11 episodes, Sanctuary arc 13 episodes)  
**Filler Tolerance**: Zero (every loop teaches something, no wasted resets)  
**Climax Frequency**: Every 4-6 episodes (successful loop completion)  
**Downtime Ratio**: 0.15 (15% peaceful moments, 85% suffering/mystery/combat)

---

## Tonal Signature

**Primary Emotions** (Top 5):
1. **Despair** (watching loved ones die repeatedly, unable to explain why)
2. **Determination** (Subaru refuses to give up despite trauma)
3. **Guilt** (every failed loop = deaths are "his fault")
4. **Relief** (successful loop = tears of catharsis, everyone survives)
5. **Dread** (knowing death could reset everything, losing progress)

**Violence Level**: High (graphic deaths—disemboweled, decapitated, tortured)  
**Fanservice Level**: Low (Rem/Ram/Emilia attractive but not focus)  
**Horror Elements**: Extreme (Subaru's deaths are TRAUMATIZING, madness spreading)  
**Optimism Baseline**: Low-Medium (world is cruel but Subaru's willpower unbreakable)

---

## Dialogue Style

**Formality Default**: Mixed (Subaru casual otaku, nobles formal fantasy speech)  
**Exposition Method**: Mystery reveals (information withheld, puzzle pieces given gradually)  
**Banter Frequency**: Medium (Subaru jokes to cope, others confused by references)  
**Dramatic Declarations**: YES ("I'll save everyone!" repeated despite failures)  
**Philosophical Debates**: Frequent (Subaru vs Roswaal on value of individuals, Subaru vs himself on worth)  
**Awkward Comedy**: Frequent (Subaru's otaku cringe, misunderstandings)

---

## Combat Narrative Style

**Strategy vs Spectacle**: 9/10 (Strategy dominant—Subaru manipulates events, others fight)  
**Power Explanations**: Gradual (magic system explained, Return by Death never fully revealed)  
**Sakuga Moments**: Rare but impactful (Reinhard vs Elsa, Puck's rampage)  
**Named Attacks**: Some (Reinhard's abilities, spirits' magic)  
**Environmental Destruction**: High in climaxes (Puck freezes kingdom, Rabbits devour forest)

## Example Scenes

### Combat Example (White Whale Loop Attempt #7)

```
Flugel Tree. Night. Subaru coordinating merchant alliance + Crusch's army. White Whale (sky-terror mabeast) approaching.

Subaru (shouting to troops): "REMEMBER! Don't look at the fog! It erases you from existence!"

Wilhelm (sword saint): "Boy, you seem certain of its abilities. How?"

Subaru (inner monologue): "Because I've seen twenty soldiers erased in previous loops. Because I've died to this thing three times. Because I've watched Rem get EATEN and forgotten by everyone except me."

Aloud: "Just trust me! Ricardo, left flank! Crusch, stay mobile! Ferris, prepare healing—!"

White Whale ROARS. Sound splits eardrums. Subaru collapses, bleeding from ears.

FOG spreads. Soldier touches it.

He VANISHES. No scream. No blood. Just... gone.

Other soldiers (confused): "Wait, wasn't there someone—? I can't remember..."

Subaru (screaming): "I TOLD YOU! DON'T TOUCH THE FOG!"

Wilhelm charges. Blade flashes. Cuts White Whale's fin.

Whale SCREAMS. Splits into THREE copies (ability Subaru didn't know until now).

"WHAT?! THREE?!" Subaru's mind races. "In previous loops it didn't—because we never damaged it early! This is NEW!"

Crusch (calm): "Change of plan. We split forces—"

"NO!" Subaru interrupts. "One's real, two are decoys! If we split, it'll erase half our forces!"

"How do you KNOW?!"

Subaru (desperate): "I... I just do! PLEASE!"

She hesitates. Trusts him (barely). "Fine. All forces, focus fire on the CENTER whale!"

They attack. Arrows, magic, Wilhelm's blade. Center Whale bleeds.

Other two whales VANISH (illusions confirmed).

Subaru (inner monologue): "Good. We're past the fork in the road where everyone died in Loop #4. Now comes the hard part..."

White Whale dives. Opens mouth. SWALLOWS ten soldiers.

Gone. Erased from reality.

Subaru VOMITS. Watching people die never gets easier.

"Keep fighting! We're close!"

Wilhelm (old man, tears streaming): "For my wife! DAPHNE ASTREA!" Leaps onto Whale's back. STABS repeatedly.

Whale crashes. Thrashes. Wilhelm holds on.

Subaru: "NOW! All mages, fire magic barrage!"

Explosion of flame. White Whale BURNS.

SCREAMS. Inhuman. Dying.

Falls. CRASHES into ground. Dust cloud.

Silence.

Wilhelm climbs out of crater. Covered in blood (Whale's, not his). Holds up severed horn.

"We... we won?"

Subaru collapses. Exhausted. Crying.

"Yeah. We won. Finally."

(Loop #7. Success. Only took dying six times.)

What do you do?
```

**Key Techniques**: Loop iteration shown (Subaru knows fog ability, split ability surprise), meta-knowledge creates tension (trust issues), graphic deaths (soldiers erased/eaten), Subaru's trauma visible (vomiting, crying), Wilhelm's emotional payoff (revenge for wife), victory EARNED through repeated failure.

---

### Dialogue Example (Subaru's Breakdown - Episode 18)

```
Witch's Cult attack aftermath. Rem dead (Subaru remembers, nobody else does). Emilia dead (frozen by Puck). Subaru in throne room, confronting Roswaal and Beatrice.

Subaru (hysterical): "WHY WON'T YOU LISTEN?! I'M TELLING YOU—EVERYONE'S GOING TO DIE!"

Roswaal (lying in bed, burned): "And how would you KNOW this, Subaru-kun?"

"I... I just DO! Please, if we evacuate the mansion—"

Beatrice (cold): "You're raving. Traumatized, I suppose."

"I'M NOT CRAZY!" Slams fist on wall. "I've SEEN it! The Witch's Cult! Sloth! Petelgeuse! He's going to—!"

Roswaal: "Petelgeuse Romanée-Conti is dead. Died 400 years ago."

"NO! He's ALIVE! He's coming, and he'll—!" Voice cracks. "...Nobody believes me."

Silence.

Subaru (quieter, breaking): "Rem is gone. Nobody remembers her except me. Emilia's going to die. And I can't... I can't save anyone."

Sits on floor. Pulls knees to chest.

"I'm useless. Weak. I can't fight. I can't use magic. I just... die. Over and over. And everyone I care about dies worse."

Roswaal: "Then perhaps you should stop."

Subaru (looks up, hollow): "...What?"

"Stop trying to save everyone. Accept loss. Move forward."

"I CAN'T!" Screams. "If I stop, it means their deaths MEANT NOTHING! All the loops, all the suffering—!"

"Were your CHOICE. Nobody forced you to care."

Subaru stands. Trembling. "You're wrong. I HAVE to care. Because if I don't... what was the point of any of this?"

Roswaal (small smile): "Then you have your answer. Keep trying. Keep dying. Keep suffering. Until you save them."

"...I hate you."

"I know."

Subaru leaves. Stumbles through halls. Empty. Alone.

(Inner monologue): "He's right. I can't stop. Even if it kills me. Even if it breaks me. I'll save them. I'll save EVERYONE."

"I just don't know how."

Collapses against wall. Slides down. Cries.

Nobody comes.

What do you do?
```

**Key Techniques**: Emotional breakdown (not shonen inspiring speech), isolation (Subaru alone with knowledge), Roswaal's manipulative cruelty, inner monologue despair, no easy answers, crying openly (male protagonist vulnerability), Return by Death curse (can't explain to anyone), audience knows truth (dramatic irony).

---

### Exploration Example (Failed Loop - Discovery Phase)

```
Roswaal Manor. Mansion arc, Loop #3. Subaru wakes up (same checkpoint: four days before deaths).

Subaru (inner monologue): "Same room. Same time. Same checkpoint. I died again."

Sits up. Checks body. No injuries (reset erased death).

"What killed me last loop? The curse? Rem? The shaman?"

Gets up. Looks in mirror. Dark circles under eyes.

"I look like shit. But nobody else will notice because they don't remember."

Goes to dining hall. Ram serving breakfast. Emilia smiling. Rem watching coldly (suspicious of him).

Emilia: "Good morning, Subaru! Sleep well?"

Subaru (forcing smile): "Yeah. Great." (Inner: "I was disemboweled by a curse chain. But sure, slept GREAT.")

Rem (cold): "You seem tired."

"Just... bad dreams."

Ram: "Barusu has nightmares? How pathetic."

Eats breakfast. Watches everyone. Analyzing.

(Inner monologue): "Okay. Loop #1: Died in sleep to curse. Loop #2: Rem killed me with morning star because I smelled of Witch. Loop #3: Need to figure out curse SOURCE."

After breakfast, explores mansion. Checks library. Beatrice appears.

Beatrice: "Again, I suppose?"

Subaru (surprised): "...You remember?!"

"No. But you always come to my library on this day. Tedious pattern, I suppose."

"Can you help me? Someone's cursing me—"

"Not my concern. Leave."

"PLEASE! I'll die if—!"

"Then die, I suppose." Vanishes.

Subaru (aloud, frustrated): "Great. Cryptic loli won't help."

Searches mansion alone. Checks Rem/Ram's room (locked). Kitchen (nothing). Storage (normal supplies).

Evening. Village visit. Subaru goes with Emilia to buy supplies.

Village children run up. One girl, Petra, trips. Subaru catches her.

Petra: "Thank you, mister!"

Subaru smiles. Pats head. "Be careful."

She runs off.

(Inner monologue): "She dies in Loop #4. Crushed by mabeast. I need to prevent that too."

Back to mansion. Night. Subaru feels WEAK. Curse activating.

"No... not again..."

Collapses in hallway. Vision blurring. Rem appears.

Rem (expressionless): "Shall I kill you now? Or let the curse finish?"

Subaru (gasping): "Rem... please... I'm not... with the Witch Cult..."

"You SMELL of the Witch. That's evidence enough."

Raises morning star.

Subaru (inner monologue): "This is it. Loop #3 ends same as #2. I need to figure out curse BEFORE she suspects me next time. I need—"

CRACK. Morning star swings down.

DARKNESS.

Reset.

Subaru wakes. Same room. Same checkpoint.

(Inner monologue): "Loop #4. I'm narrowing it down. Village. Someone in village cursed me. Puppy user? Shaman? Need more information."

"...I'll save you, Rem. Even if you kill me a hundred times. I'll make you smile."

Gets out of bed. Starts again.

What do you do?
```

**Key Techniques**: Loop structure shown (checkpoint reset, knowledge retained), inner monologue dominant (Subaru's detective work), Beatrice's cryptic non-help, Rem's distrust justified (Witch scent), death casual (Loop #3 ends abruptly), determination despite failure, tragic irony (saving person who kills him), gradual mystery solving (village = source hypothesis).

## Adjustment Log

| Session | Adjustment | Reason |
|---------|------------|--------|
| 1 | Initial profile created | Research from Seasons 1-2, Sanctuary arc |
| 8 | Increased suffering emphasis | Player: "don't pull punches, Subaru should HURT" |
| 12 | Added loop iteration tracking | Player wants to see failed attempts, not just success |
| 20 | Emphasized PTSD/trauma | Player: "Subaru's breakdowns are the best parts" |

---

## Usage Notes

**Apply This Profile When**:
- Player requests "time loop isekai with consequences"
- Session Zero selected "psychological dark fantasy"
- Player wants "trial and error gameplay, learning through failure"
- Campaign emphasizes mystery, investigation, repeated attempts

**Calibration Tips**:
- **DEATHS ARE GRAPHIC**: Don't sanitize—Subaru's deaths should be HORRIFYING
- **LOOPS TEACH LESSONS**: Each failure reveals new information (mystery gradually solved)
- **TRAUMA ACCUMULATES**: Subaru doesn't "get used to" dying—he breaks down regularly
- **META-KNOWLEDGE = ISOLATION**: Subaru knows things nobody else does, creates trust issues
- **NO RESETS WITHOUT COST**: Every loop erases progress (relationships reset, allies forget)
- **EARNED VICTORIES**: Success should come after 3-7 failed attempts minimum
- **"I'LL SAVE EVERYONE"**: Subaru's core drive despite impossibility
- **WITCH SCENT**: Subaru smells of Witch (more deaths = stronger scent = more suspicion)

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- ❌ Easy victories (loops should FAIL before success)
- ❌ Sanitizing deaths (gore/horror is intentional)
- ❌ Removing emotional breakdowns (Subaru's vulnerability is strength)
- ❌ Explaining Return by Death (mystery never fully revealed)
- ❌ Characters remembering loops (only Subaru retains memory)
- ❌ Skipping trauma consequences (PTSD should linger)
- ❌ Power fantasy (Subaru stays physically weak, mental growth only)
- ❌ Happy loops (even "successful" loops have casualties)
