## Narrative Scales (0-10)

### 1. Introspection vs Action: **8/10** (Introspection-Heavy)

Death Note is a **psychological thriller masquerading as supernatural crime drama**—action scenes are nonexistent, replaced entirely by internal monologue warfare. Light and L spend entire episodes **thinking at each other** while maintaining polite facades. Episode 2's Death Note acquisition: 5 minutes of Light's internal debate (moral philosophy, god complex rationalization, consequence analysis) before single name written. Episode 7's tennis match: physical game serves as **metaphor** for mental chess—dialogue is surface banter, inner monologue reveals actual strategies ("If I lose this point, L will interpret as admission of guilt. I must win naturally to avoid suspicion."). The famous **potato chip scene (Episode 8)** epitomizes this: mundane action (eating chips) conceals strategic murder, narrated through 60 seconds of Light's internal calculus. L mirrors this—episodes 11-15 show him reviewing surveillance footage with **inner monologue explaining deductive leaps** ("40-second delay suggests manual activation... Kira must write names... Death Note confirmed."). Both protagonists **perform** normalcy while narrating ruthless plans. AIDM Guidance: **Favor internal monologue over external action**. Every NPC gesture should trigger PC's strategic analysis ("Why did L add 5 sugar cubes instead of usual 4? Signal? Coincidence? Trap?"). Combat = psychological (convincing L you're innocent while secretly plotting his murder). Physical scenes (chase sequences, confrontations) are **rare dramatic punctuation**, not default mode.

---

### 2. Comedy vs Drama: **8/10** (Drama-Dominant with Awkward Humor)

Drama overwhelms—Light's corruption, L's obsessive pursuit, philosophical debates about justice consume 90% runtime. Comedy exists as **uncomfortable relief**: L's sugar addiction (Episode 9: adding 12 cubes to coffee, deadpan "This is how I think"), Ryuk's apple obsession creating inconvenient moments (Episode 13: Light forced to buy apples mid-investigation or Ryuk throws tantrum), Light's "perfect student" facade cracking (Episode 6: overly enthusiastic tennis serve to prove innocence, looks deranged). Misa's introduction (Episode 14) brings romantic comedy beats that feel **deliberately jarring**—her cheerful obsession with Light contrasts his cold manipulation, creating dark humor ("I'd do anything for you, Light!" / Light's internal monologue: "Useful tool. Will dispose after."). Critical: comedy never undermines stakes. L's quirks (sitting oddly, eating sweets) are **character depth**, not comic relief—his methods work despite looking absurd. Light's rare smiles (Episode 25: "Just as planned" grin) terrify because they reveal god complex beneath mask. AIDM Guidance: **Comedy is character quirk or tonal whiplash, never extended relief**. L orders cake during murder investigation—awkward but doesn't stop tension. Light's "normal teenager" performance (laughing at family dinner) is horror in disguise. Use humor to **highlight psychological abnormality**, not lighten mood.

---

### 3. Simple vs Complex: **9/10** (Multi-Layered 4D Chess)

Death Note operates on **minimum three layers of deception simultaneously**. Episode 7 example: Surface layer (Light and L play tennis, friendly rivals), Strategic layer (Light intentionally loses to avoid appearing competitive/suspicious, L intentionally lets him lose to gauge reaction), Meta layer (both know the other is performing, watching for microexpressions that reveal true intent). Light's schemes require **contingency planning 10 steps deep**: Lind L. Tailor trap (Episode 2)—Light kills fake L on TV, real L narrows location, Light realizes mistake AFTER, plans counter-counter strategy. Yotsuba arc (Episodes 20-25): Light **erases own memory** to appear innocent during investigation, pre-plans memory restoration via hidden notes, manipulates Rem into killing L, achieves victory through **voluntary amnesia gambit**. L's investigation matches complexity: surveillance (50+ cameras in Light's room), psychological profiling (analyzing microexpressions frame-by-frame), probability calculations (Episode 11: "97% certainty Light is Kira, but 3% doubt prevents arrest"). Every conversation is **chess match**—"Want to go to cafe?" means "I'm testing your reaction to off-schedule activity." AIDM Guidance: **Plans should have contingencies visible only in hindsight**. PC says "I'll take a walk"—reveal 3 episodes later that walk was reconnaissance for future scheme. NPCs (L-tier) should **counter PC's plans with equal complexity**. Avoid explaining schemes before payoff—dramatic irony > spoilers.

---

### 4. Power Fantasy vs Struggle: **5/10** (Overpowered but Stalemated)

Light wields **god-tier power** (Death Note kills anyone whose name/face he knows) but faces **equal opposition** creating perpetual stalemate. Episode 1-2: Light easily kills criminals, feels omnipotent. Episode 3: L enters—immediately narrows Kira's location to Japan via Lind L. Tailor trap, neutralizes Light's advantage. Pattern continues: Light uses Shinigami Eyes (Episode 19) for instant kill capability, but Rem's limitations (can't kill to extend human lifespan without dying) create vulnerability L exploits. Power fantasy elements exist (Light eliminates FBI agents trailing him, Episodes 6-8, feels unstoppable) but are **immediately punished** (Naomi Misora nearly catches him, Episode 7, forcing desperate improvisation). L's powerlessness (no supernatural abilities, must use evidence) makes him **equally threatening**—Episode 11: survives Light's trap through paranoia (sends decoy, expects assassination attempt). The 5/10 rating reflects **symmetrical struggle**: Light has power, L has intelligence, neither can decisively win. Episodes 20-25 epitomize this—Light erases memory to gain innocence, loses Death Note, succeeds in appearing innocent, but trapped in L's surveillance, regaining memory requires near-suicidal risk. AIDM Guidance: **Power should create problems, not solve them**. Death Note makes Light target—every kill brings L closer. PC with god-power should face **equally cunning opposition** that neutralizes brute force. Struggle comes from mental chess, not physical limitations.

---

### 5. Explained vs Mysterious: **7/10** (Exhaustive Post-Reveal Explanations)

Death Note **withholds plans until payoff, then explains exhaustively**. Light's schemes appear miraculous—Episode 8: criminals die during surveillance despite Light having no apparent opportunity. Reveal (20 minutes later via flashback): Light hid mini-TV in chip bag, pre-recorded names in Death Note pages, timed kills to align with "eating chips" performance. This pattern repeats: L's moves seem random until inner monologue reveals logic ("I placed cameras in Light's room, but also in Raye Penber's widow's apartment—if Light contacts her, proves Kira identity."). Mystery maintained through **selective information**—audience sees Light write names but doesn't know victims' identities until deaths broadcast. Rules revealed gradually: Episode 2 (touch Death Note to see Shinigami), Episode 13 (ownership transfer erases memories), Episode 20 (Shinigami can't kill to extend human lifespan without dying). L's deductions are shown, not explained, until critical moment—Episode 15: L arrests Misa, reveals 5-episode investigation summarized in 10-minute monologue. AIDM Guidance: **Show plans in action, explain via flashback or inner monologue afterward**. Let players experience mystery (NPC does something inexplicable), reward attention (flashback reveals clues were visible all along). Avoid "L planned this" without showing HOW—Death Note earns revelations through meticulous setup.

---

### 6. Fast-Paced vs Slow Burn: **6/10** (Deliberate, Methodical Escalation)

Single schemes span **3-5 episodes**—Lind L. Tailor trap (Episode 2), FBI agent elimination (Episodes 6-8), Misa's investigation (Episodes 13-17), memory gambit (Episodes 20-25). Each episode advances incrementally: L places cameras (Episode 5), Light discovers cameras (Episode 6), Light plans workaround (Episode 7), executes plan (Episode 8). Pacing is **methodical**—scenes linger on characters thinking, analyzing, reacting. Episode 7: 8-minute sequence of Light eating potato chips, extended by dramatic music, camera angles, inner monologue stretching mundane action into suspense. Contrast with action anime: Death Note's "climax" (Episode 25: L's death) is **quiet conversation** where L admits defeat, Light smiles, no combat. Slow burn creates pressure-cooker tension—audience knows Light is Kira (dramatic irony), watches L **slowly** close in, Light's escapes feel temporary, inevitable confrontation looms. Episodes 15-19: L and Light **handcuffed together 24/7**, investigations continue, hostility simmering under polite cooperation. AIDM Guidance: **One scheme per session, not per scene**. Let players **sit in tension**—NPC investigator analyzes their alibi for entire session, no resolution. Slow pacing amplifies paranoia (PC wonders: "Did I make a mistake 3 sessions ago that's coming back now?"). Avoid instant resolutions—Death Note victories take time.

---

### 7. Episodic vs Serialized: **10/10** (Hyper-Serialized Consequences)

Every action has **consequences 10-20 episodes later**. Episode 1: Light kills Lind L. Tailor, reveals location to L. Episode 25: L uses that same recklessness as evidence ("You acted emotionally, not strategically—proves you're human, not god."). Episode 4: Light kills Raye Penber (FBI agent). Episodes 6-8: Raye's widow Naomi investigates, nearly catches Light. Episode 13: L connects Naomi's disappearance to Kira timeline. Episode 25: That connection becomes final proof. Nothing is forgotten—Light's early kills (criminals with no connection to police intel) become evidence L uses to narrow suspect pool (Episode 10: "Only someone with police access would know these names."). Serialization extends to character arcs: Light's god complex (Episode 1: "I'll become god of new world") escalates through hubris (Episode 15: openly taunting L), peaks in memory loss arc (Episode 20-25: innocent Light horrified by Kira, returns to god complex upon remembering), culminates in death (Episode 37: "I'm god!" while dying pathetically). L's arc: initial confidence (Episode 3: "I'll catch Kira within 40 days") → obsession (Episode 15: hasn't slept in 72 hours) → acceptance of mortality (Episode 25: "Light... you are Kira."). AIDM Guidance: **Track every PC action across sessions**. Alibi given in Session 3 should be investigated Session 7. NPCs remember contradictions. "Just as planned" moments require **multi-session setup**—PC plants evidence Session 1, activated Session 8. Use callback reveals (flashback to earlier scene, showing hidden meaning).

---

### 8. Grounded vs Absurd: **4/10** (Supernatural Premise, Grounded Execution)

**Supernatural foundation** (Death Note kills via name-writing, Shinigami exist, Shinigami Eyes trade lifespan for kill-vision) applied with **police procedural realism**. L's investigation uses actual forensic methods: handwriting analysis (Episode 5: examining Raye Penber's notes), surveillance legality debates (Episode 11: police question wiretapping ethics), criminal profiling (Episode 10: "Kira is student or office worker based on kill-time patterns."). Light's kills analyzed scientifically—heart attack patterns, timing consistency, geographic distribution. Episode 7: L calculates probability Kira needs "face + name" via statistical analysis of victim selection. Absurdity exists in **premise, not execution**: Ryuk (Shinigami) designs are grotesque but behavior is casual (eats apples, makes sarcastic comments, doesn't interfere). Death Note rules are **internally consistent**—once established (must write name within 40 seconds while visualizing face), series obeys them absolutely. Episode 25: Light's victory depends on exploiting rule loophole (Shinigami who kills to extend human lifespan dies—Rem loves Misa, killing L extends Misa's life, Rem dies). Grounded emotional realism—Light's corruption shown through microexpressions, family dinners where he **performs normalcy**, quiet moments of god complex surfacing. AIDM Guidance: **Supernatural mechanics should be consistent, emotionally grounded**. Magic item (Death Note equivalent) has clear rules, violations are plot-critical. Characters react realistically to absurd situations—PC gets god-power, initially horrified, gradually corrupted. Investigations use **real-world logic** even when investigating magic.

---

### 9. Tactical vs Instinctive: **10/10** (Pure Calculated Strategy)

**Zero impulsive actions**—every word, gesture, potato chip is calculated. Episode 2: Light kills Lind L. Tailor impulsively (believes he's real L), immediately regrets ("I acted emotionally—L baited me."), spends next 23 episodes compensating via hyper-vigilance. After that: pure tactics. Episode 7: Light eats chips for strategic reasons (performing normalcy during kill to avoid surveillance detection). Episode 11: L adds 12 sugar cubes to coffee **deliberately** (testing if Light notices pattern change, gauging observational skills). Episode 18: Light's date with Misa is **performance** (pretending romance to align their Kira stories, every kiss calculated for L's surveillance cameras). Characters think in probabilities—L: "97% certain Light is Kira, but need 100% for arrest." Light: "If I kill L now, successor will suspect me. Must wait until successor identified, eliminate both simultaneously." Conversations are **verbal chess**: L: "Light, you're too perfect." Light: "Being good student makes me criminal?" L: "No, but statistical anomaly suggests performance." Light: "Circular logic." L: "Correct—which is why I'm still watching." Every line is **move/countermove**. Instinct doesn't exist—Light's "intuition" (Episode 23: sensing danger) is actually unconscious pattern recognition from tactical analysis. AIDM Guidance: **NPCs should telegraph intentions through micro-plans**. "Let's get coffee" = investigation probe. PC actions should have **multi-turn setup**. Impulsive actions should be punished catastrophically (Light's Episode 2 mistake haunts entire series). Favor **long-term schemes over reactive tactics**.

---

### 10. Hopeful vs Cynical: **7/10** (Cynical Tragedy)

Death Note's world is **morally bankrupt**—Light's "justice" is fascist dystopia (executing criminals without trial, killing dissenters), L's "justice" is authoritarian (illegal surveillance, torture threats, manipulating suspects). No heroes exist: Light becomes tyrant, L admits "I'm solving puzzle, not saving people." Episode 25: L dies, Light wins, world becomes **worse** (Kira worshiped as god, thought-police state). Post-L arc (Episodes 26-37): Kira's "utopia" revealed as nightmare—crime drops but society lives in fear, Light executes non-criminals who oppose him, becomes what he hated. Supporting cast complicit: Misa (willing accomplice to mass murder out of "love"), Light's father (chooses son over justice, dies regretting it), Near (defeats Light but admits world may be better under Kira). Episode 37 ending: Light dies pathetically (begging Ryuk for help, shot, crawling), but Kira's ideology survives (cults worship him posthumously). **No happy ending possible**—Light's victory = dystopia, Light's defeat = personal tragedy + ideological legacy remains. Rare hopeful moments exist (Light's brief memory loss, Episodes 20-24, shows he could've been good person) but are **eliminated** when memory returns ("That weak version of me is dead."). AIDM Guidance: **Present moral ambiguity without easy answers**. "Kira is evil" vs "Kira reduced crime 70%" = both true. PC's methods should **corrupt them**—start idealist, become tyrant through incremental compromises. Victories should feel **hollow** (defeated enemy, but at what cost?). Avoid straightforward heroism—Death Note's power fantasy is nightmare fuel.

---

### 11. Narrative Focus (Ensemble ←→ Solo): **1/10** (Extreme Solo Protagonist with Deuteragonist)

**Light dominates ~85% of narrative POV**—series opens with his perspective, follows his plans, ends with his death. L receives ~10% POV (Episodes 8, 11, 15: internal monologues, deductive sequences), making him **deuteragonist** not co-protagonist. Supporting cast (Misa, Matsuda, Light's father) get <5% combined POV, primarily through Light's lens (Episode 14: Misa's introduction shown via Light's analysis of her usefulness). Structural model: **Strategic Solo with Adversarial Deuteragonist**—Light's plans are A-plot, L's investigation is B-plot that intersects A-plot. Episodes 1-6: Light-only POV. Episode 7: First L internal monologue (reviewing surveillance). Episodes 8-25: Alternating Light/L perspectives create dramatic irony (audience sees both plans colliding). Post-L arc (26-37): returns to Light-heavy POV (~90%), Near/Mello receive minimal internal access. Spotlight allocation: Episode 8 (potato chip scene) = 18 minutes Light's perspective, 2 minutes L's reaction. Episode 25 (L's death) = 10 minutes Light/L confrontation (split evenly), then Light's victory monologue.

**AIDM Calibration for Solo-Protagonist Death Note Campaigns**:
- **PRIMARY NARRATOR**: PC (Light equivalent) provides 80%+ inner monologue, plans, schemes
- **DEUTERAGONIST ACCESS**: Major rival (L equivalent) gets occasional POV to show investigative progress, create dramatic irony
- **ENSEMBLE MINIMIZED**: Supporting NPCs are tools/obstacles, minimal internal access unless critical to PC's scheme
- **DRAMATIC IRONY STRUCTURE**: Reveal antagonist's plan progress (L knows PC is Kira suspect) while PC schemes unaware
- **STRATEGIC SOLO PACING**: Extended scenes of PC planning alone (analyzing evidence, writing Death Note, internal debates)
- **ADVERSARIAL NARRATION**: Alternate PC's scheme explanation with rival's counter-scheme, show collision

When players request **"I want to be genius mastermind like Light"**: frame campaign around **their strategic inner monologue** (70% session is PC thinking, planning, performing normalcy), with **rival investigator** getting 10-15% narrative time to establish threat (DM describes L's progress independently: "Meanwhile, L reviews footage. His eyes narrow. 'Anomaly detected...'"). Supporting cast exists to be manipulated (Misa equivalent), opposed (task force), or protected (family). Avoid ensemble splitting—Death Note succeeds through **hyper-focused protagonist perspective**, with rival providing dramatic irony contrast. PC should feel **paranoid isolation** (everyone's potential threat), not fellowship (ensemble bonding). Session structure: 80% PC's schemes/performance/analysis, 15% rival's investigation reveals, 5% supporting cast reactions. This creates Death Note's signature tension: **PC knows they're hunted, rival knows PC is culprit, both perform normalcy while plotting mutual destruction**.

---

## Storytelling Tropes (ON/OFF)

### Cat-and-Mouse ✅ **CORE STRUCTURE**
**Light vs L defines entire narrative**—hunter and hunted roles constantly reverse. Episodes 1-2: L hunts anonymous Kira. Episode 3-7: Light hunts L (trying to discover real name). Episodes 8-25: Simultaneous hunt (both know the other is enemy, can't prove it). Structure: **Move/Countermove**—Light kills criminals using specific pattern (Episode 4), L analyzes pattern and predicts next kill location (Episode 5), Light detects analysis and changes pattern (Episode 6), creating spiral. Episode 18 epitomizes this: Light and L handcuffed together 24/7, investigating Yotsuba Kira, both secretly manipulating investigation to frame/absolve the other. Cat-and-mouse extends to conversations—every "casual" interaction is interrogation (Episode 11: L's "Let's play tennis" = testing Light's competitiveness). Climax (Episode 25): Cat catches mouse (L confirms Light is Kira), mouse kills cat (Light uses Rem to eliminate L), **both win and lose simultaneously**. AIDM Application: Every NPC rival should have **symmetric goals**—PC hunts them, they hunt PC, advantage shifts constantly. Investigations should be **duels** (PC's alibi vs NPC's deduction). Avoid one-sided hunts—Death Note's tension comes from **mutual predation**.

### Dramatic Irony ✅ **AUDIENCE OMNISCIENCE**
**Viewers know Light is Kira from Episode 1**—entire series is watching L close in while Light obfuscates. Episode 7: L directly states "Light, you're my top suspect," Light smiles politely, audience knows he's Kira, L knows he's Kira, Light knows L knows—nobody can prove it. This creates **layered tension**: surface level (will L find evidence?), meta level (Light's performance convincing enough?), dramatic level (audience sees clues L misses or doesn't miss). Episode 15: Misa captured, audience knows she's Second Kira + loves Light, L interrogates her, Misa says nothing, Light watches via surveillance knowing L will eventually break her. Dramatic irony extends to **dual narration**—Episode 8 shows Light's plan (potato chip scene inner monologue), then shows L watching surveillance wondering "How is he killing during surveillance?"—audience knows answer, L doesn't, tension comes from **when/if L discovers**. Episode 20-25 subverts this: Light erases memory, becomes genuinely innocent, **audience knows he was Kira but Light doesn't**, creating tragic irony (innocent Light horrified by Kira's crimes, unaware he IS Kira). AIDM Application: **Reveal PC's guilt/plans to players via inner monologue, keep NPCs in dark**. Let players watch investigator NPC slowly piece together evidence they already know exists. Tension = "When will they figure it out?" not "What's happening?"

### Inner Monologue ✅ **CONSTANT DUAL NARRATION**
**Light and L narrate every action's strategic purpose**—Episode 2: Light walks to convenience store, 30-second inner monologue ("If I buy juice now, sets routine. Later, break routine to establish alibi. Ryuk wants apples—buying them seems natural, actually tests if Shinigami visible to others via cashier reactions."). Episode 11: L eats cake, inner monologue ("Sweet intake increases cognitive function 12%. Light watching my eating habits—appearing eccentric lowers his guard. Also, this cake is delicious."). **Dual perspectives create dramatic irony**: Episode 18 shows Light thinking "L suspects I'm Kira, must act innocent" while L simultaneously thinks "Light is Kira, but his performance is flawless—need evidence." Conversations become chess matches with **visible strategies**—spoken dialogue = polite banter, inner monologue = ruthless analysis. Episode 7 tennis: Light says "Good game!" thinks "Losing makes me seem non-competitive, reduces suspicion." L says "Likewise!" thinks "Intentional loss confirms profile—he's managing my perception." Inner monologue also reveals **moral corruption**—Episode 14: Light meets Misa, thinks "Useful pawn, will manipulate her love to control Second Kira, discard after." Audience hears unfiltered sociopathy beneath charming exterior. AIDM Application: **Narrate PC's strategic reasoning constantly**—describe convenience store trip, ask "What are you thinking?", let players explain tactical purpose. For major NPCs (L-equivalent), provide **occasional inner monologue** to show investigation progress ("The timing of that answer... 0.3 second delay. He's lying."). Make mundane actions strategic via narration.

### Plans Within Plans ✅ **MULTI-LAYERED CONTINGENCIES**
**Every scheme has 3+ backup plans**—Episode 8 (potato chip scene): Plan A (kill during surveillance undetected via chip bag Death Note), Plan B (if caught mid-write, fake studying notes), Plan C (if cameras detect hidden TV, claim watching educational content), Plan D (if arrested, trigger memory loss via Death Note forfeit clause). Light plans **10 episodes ahead**—Episode 14: meets Misa, immediately plans her role in Yotsuba arc (Episodes 20-25), plants memory restoration trigger (fake name reveal tactic). L mirrors this: Episode 5 surveillance (cameras in Light's room) includes Plan B (microphones in family living room), Plan C (tracking Light's purchases for Death Note materials), Plan D (if Light isn't Kira, surveillance narrows actual Kira location via elimination). Episode 25 pinnacle: Light's victory requires **simultaneous execution of 6 interlocking schemes** (memory loss to appear innocent, Rem's love for Misa as kill-trigger, Higuchi as patsy, fake Death Note rules to mislead L, Second Kira manipulating task force, L's deduction predicted and weaponized). Plans **fail forward**—Episode 7: Light's plan to kill L via Raye Penber fails (Penber suspicious), Light adapts mid-scheme (kills Penber + all FBI agents instead, larger victory). AIDM Application: **PC schemes should require multi-session setup**—plant evidence Session 1, activate contingency Session 4, reveal true purpose Session 7. NPCs should have **counter-contingencies** (L expects Light's plan, has trap waiting). Encourage players to think "If Plan A fails, what's Plan B/C/D?" Reward planning depth with success.

### Existential Philosophy ✅ **MORAL DEBATES AS CORE THEME**
**Justice, morality, utilitarianism debated every 3 episodes**—Light's ideology ("Sacrifice few criminals to save majority of innocents") vs L's counter ("Who judges the judge? Power without accountability is tyranny"). Episode 12: Light's father (police chief) debates with task force: "Kira is murderer" vs "Kira reduced crime 70%—maybe necessary evil?" No easy answer given. Episode 25: L admits to Light (knowing he's dying): "You're justice, I'm justice. We're both correct in our own philosophies, incompatible in practice. Killing you would make me villain in Kira's world. Not killing you makes me failure in mine." Light's god complex explored philosophically—Episode 18: "Humans are short-sighted. They need god to guide them to utopia. I'll become that god, even if they hate me for it. A kind world requires sacrifice of the unkind." L counters: "Your utopia is built on fear. Criminals stopped killing not from morality, but terror. That's not peace—it's oppression." Series refuses to answer "Who's right?"—Episode 37 ending shows Kira's death but ideology survives (cults worship him), suggesting **ideas can't be killed**. Existentialism extends to Ryuk—Episode 1: "Humans are interesting. You create complex moralities, then violate them. Light thinks he's god, but he's just bored human with toy." Philosophy isn't preachy—embedded in action (Light's kills = utilitarian calculus, L's investigation = deontological justice). AIDM Application: **NPCs should articulate opposing moral frameworks**—villain isn't evil, has coherent philosophy ("Greater good requires hard choices"). Let PC argue ideology through actions (kill criminal to save 10 innocents—utilitarian vs "murder is always wrong" deontological). Avoid authorial answer—present dilemmas, let players wrestle with implications.

### Tragic Descent ✅ **PROTAGONIST CORRUPTION ARC**
**Light begins idealistic, becomes monster incrementally**—Episode 1: "I'll eliminate evil, create perfect world" (altruistic, naive). Episode 2: Kills Lind L. Tailor impulsively, regrets it ("I acted emotionally—weakness"). Episode 4-8: Kills FBI agents to protect identity (self-preservation, defensible). Episode 12: Kills criminals' families if they oppose Kira (escalation—innocents die). Episode 18: Manipulates Misa's love, treats her as disposable tool ("When she's no longer useful, I'll kill her myself."). Episode 25: Kills L, best friend's figure, laughs triumphantly ("Finally, the trash is gone."). Episode 37: Begs for life pathetically, god complex shattered, dies crawling. **Incremental moral decay**—each compromise easier than last. Light's internal justifications evolve: Episode 1 ("Criminals deserve death") → Episode 8 ("FBI agents chose to hunt me, casualties of war") → Episode 18 ("Anyone who opposes Kira opposes utopia, must be eliminated") → Episode 37 ("Everyone's beneath me, pawns in my world"). Microexpressions show corruption: Episode 1 Light trembles killing first criminal, Episode 37 Light kills with bored expression. Family scenes highlight loss—Episode 4: Light genuinely loves father/sister, Episode 25: sees family as obstacles to manage, Episode 37: father dies believing son is innocent, Light thinks "Useful that he died believing the lie." Tragic because corruption is **self-inflicted**—power doesn't corrupt Light, Light's ego corrupts him, Death Note merely provides means. AIDM Application: **Track PC's moral compromises across sessions**—first kill should horrify them, tenth kill should feel routine. NPCs should call out changes ("You've become cold. What happened?"). Ending should show PC **losing humanity** they fought to protect.

### Mystery Box ✅ **GRADUAL RULE REVEALS**
**Death Note mechanics disclosed piecemeal across 37 episodes**—Episode 1: "Write name while picturing face = heart attack." Episode 2: "Death customizable (cause/time)." Episode 4: "Must write surname + given name." Episode 7: "40-second limit after seeing face." Episode 13: "Forfeiting ownership erases memories." Episode 20: "Touching Death Note shows Shinigami." Episode 25: "Fake rules can be written to deceive." Each reveal is **plot critical**—Episode 13's memory rule enables Yotsuba arc (Light forfeits Death Note, becomes innocent, plans restoration). Episode 25's fake rules twist enables Light's victory (L believes rule "user dies if unused 13 days," spares Light, actually false rule). Mystery structure: **Rules established, then exploited**—Episode 2 introduces customizable death, Episode 8 exploits it (delay deaths to create alibis). L investigates rules scientifically—Episode 11: tests Death Note via criminal (writes name, observes death, confirms mechanics), theorizes limitations ("Kira needs face—must have seen victim. Needs name—must have learned it. Conclusion: Kira has access to police database."). Shinigami rules revealed rarely—Episode 27: Rem can kill to extend human lifespan but dies doing so (establishes L's death method). Mystery boxes stack—Death Note rules, Kira's identity, L's real name, Second Kira's existence, Near/Mello's plans. AIDM Application: **Introduce magic item/power with basic rules, reveal advanced mechanics gradually**. Let PC discover exploits through experimentation. NPCs should **test rules scientifically** (L-equivalent investigates magic systematically). Avoid dumping all rules upfront—mystery comes from unknown limitations.

### Rapid Tonal Shifts ✅ **RARE BUT DEVASTATING**
**Light's mask slipping creates horror**—Episode 1: Light at family dinner, laughing at sister's joke (wholesome), immediately cuts to Light in bedroom writing names, maniacal smile (psychopath). Episode 8: potato chip scene oscillates—Light acts "normal teenager eating snacks" for cameras, smash cuts to internal monologue ("Die, criminal scum!"), back to exterior calm. Episode 25: Light's victory—polite conversation with L about investigation, L says "You are Kira" (quiet, sad), Light smiles and says "Prove it," L dies silently, Light laughs hysterically alone. Tonal shifts highlight **duality**—Light performs normalcy but interior is rot. Episode 14: Light's first date with Misa (rom-com framing: fireworks, confession, kiss) undercut by Light's inner monologue ("She's useful tool. I'll manipulate her love, discard when convenient."). Comedy-to-horror: Episode 20—Light without memories acts genuinely heroic (investigates Kira, morally outraged), regains memories mid-episode, cheerful "I'm Kira!" revelation murders sympathetic Light personality. L's shifts subtler—Episode 15: childishly eating cake → deadpan "I'll execute Light if guilty, even though I consider him first friend I've had." Whiplash isn't frequent (unlike Code Geass)—Death Note uses it **sparingly for maximum impact** (2-3 major shifts per arc). AIDM Application: **Let PC perform normalcy, then show private corruption**. Family dinner session (PC roleplays warmth), end with private scene (PC's true thoughts: "They're liabilities."). Use tonal shift to reveal **character truth hidden beneath performance**. Rare but impactful—not every scene, but critical moments.

### Power of Friendship ❌ **DISABLED: ISOLATION & MANIPULATION**
**Light has zero genuine friendships**—every relationship is transactional. Episode 14: Misa loves Light, Light sees her as "Second Kira asset, will eliminate post-utility." Episode 18: L claims Light is "closest thing to friend I've had," Light thinks "Friendship is weakness, will exploit his trust." Light's father (police chief) trusts son completely, Light uses that trust to access police intel (Episode 6-12). Episode 25: Light kills L without hesitation—closest rival/friend/intellectual equal, murdered to achieve goal. L equally isolated—Episode 22 admits "I don't have friends, only suspects and assets." Light's family (sister Sayu, father Soichiro) love him genuinely, but Light sees them as **security blanket** (maintaining normal appearance) not emotional anchors. Episode 36: Near captures Sayu as hostage, Light's calculus is strategic ("Sayu's death damages my credibility, must rescue her") not emotional. Contrast with shonen: Naruto wins via friendship, Light wins via **strategic isolation** (trusting nobody, manipulating everyone). Episode 37 reinforces this—Light dies alone, begging Ryuk (who he never befriended, only used) for help. Ryuk kills him with Death Note ("Sorry Light. It's just business."). Message: **Power requires isolation, friendship is liability**. AIDM Application: **Disable cooperative bonding mechanics**—PC who relies on allies should face betrayal. NPCs presented as "friends" should have ulterior motives (L befriends Light to gather evidence). Victories come from **out-scheming opponents**, not "power of bonds." Trust is weakness to exploit.

### Tournament Arcs ❌ **DISABLED: ZERO COMBAT**
**No physical confrontations exist**—Light and L never fight, Near never battles Light, Misa's combat role (Shinigami Eyes) is utility not tournament. Episode 25 (L's death) = quiet conversation, no combat. Episode 37 (Light's defeat) = Near reveals evidence, Light

 panics, shot by Matsuda, dies crawling—no final battle. "Combat" is **mental**—debates, deductions, schemes. Episode 18's "duel": Light and L interrogate Yotsuba Kira via verbal traps (not physical). Episode 8's "fight": Light vs surveillance cameras (avoiding detection while killing). No power level escalation—Light's Death Note capabilities don't grow stronger, strategies become more elaborate. L doesn't "power up"—just outsmarts via deduction. Post-L arc lacks tournaments—Near vs Light is **notebook analysis battle** (comparing Death Note rules, finding contradictions). Mello's confrontation (Episode 28-35) involves kidnapping, but resolution is strategic (Light predicts Mello's plan, counters with Mikami as proxy). Series could have introduced "Shinigami battles" or "Death Note users tournament"—**deliberately avoids this**. Victory conditions are intellectual: catch killer (L's goal), eliminate detective (Light's goal), no "defeat in combat." AIDM Application: **Remove combat as conflict resolution**—enemies defeated via evidence, blackmail, manipulation, not HP reduction. "Boss fights" are **interrogations** or **trials**. Avoid power escalation (stronger Death Note)—escalate **strategic complexity** instead. PC vs NPC "duel" = scheme vs counter-scheme, not swords.

### Slice-of-Life ❌ **DISABLED: STRATEGIC MUNDANITY**
**Mundane moments serve tactical purposes**—Light's school life (attending classes, tennis, studying) is performance to maintain innocence. Episode 6: Light joins tennis club specifically to appear normal teenager, creates alibis via practice schedules. Episode 12: Light's family dinner shown only to establish father's police access (Light manipulates conversation to extract intel). L's "slice-of-life" (eating cake, building towers with sugar cubes) is **character quirk revealing psychology** (obsessive personality, sensory coping mechanism), not relaxation. Episode 20-24: Light without memories attends university, dates, seems normal—but series frames this as **aberration** (temporary innocence, tragedy = he'll return to Kira). No "beach episodes" or "festival episodes"—every scene advances plot/investigation. Episode 15: Light and L visit university together, appears casual outing, actually interrogation (L watching Light's reactions to campus environments, testing theory Light is student). Misa's idol career (concerts, photoshoots) shown only when relevant to Kira plot (Episode 14: public appearance gives alibi for Second Kira kill). Contrast with series like Bebop (slice-of-life episodes explore character), Death Note uses mundanity as **tactical camouflage** or **investigative evidence**. Episode 8: Light's daily routine (wake 6 AM, study 2 hours, tennis practice) analyzed by L for patterns revealing kill-times. AIDM Application: **Mundane activities should have strategic purpose**—PC attends party to establish alibi, not for fun. Downtime = planning sessions (PC schemes during "rest"). NPCs analyze PC's routine for clues. No relaxation exists—even sleep is tactical (Light memorizes Death Note pages before bed, visualizes victims while "sleeping").

### Rule of Cool ❌ **DISABLED: LOGIC-JUSTIFIED ACTIONS**
**Everything requires tactical justification**—Light doesn't write names dramatically "because cool," does so because specific Death Note rule requires visualization (Episode 2). L sits oddly not for aesthetic, but because posture aids thinking (Episode 8: L explains "Deductive capability decreases 40% in normal sitting position."). Episode 8's potato chip scene **appears** over-the-top dramatic (music swells, dramatic lighting, intense chip-eating), but series frames this as **Light's internal theatrics** (performing normalcy while murdering, psychological dualism). Every "cool" moment has pragmatic basis: L's cake tower (Episode 11) = hand-eye coordination exercise + glucose intake for cognition. Light's perfect student persona = strategic performance (valedictorian status provides alibi via reputation management). Episode 25: Light's victory isn't epic battle, it's **logically sound scheme execution** (Rem's death = mathematically inevitable given established rules + L's deduction). Near's toy habits (Episode 28-37: playing with puppets, building card towers) justified as investigation visualization tools (physical models of suspect relationships). Contrast with series prioritizing spectacle (Bleach: swords flashy, tactics secondary)—Death Note prioritizes **cause-effect logic** (actions succeed because sound reasoning, not because protagonist). Episode 37: Light's defeat is **logical** (Near exploited Death Note rules + Light's pride), not deus ex machina. AIDM Application: **Require players to justify "cool" actions tactically**—want to do dramatic speech during confrontation? Explain strategic purpose (intimidation, misdirection, time-buying). NPCs shouldn't act on "rule of cool"—every action logical. Reward players for **sound reasoning** over flashy ideas.

### Mundane Epic ❌ **DISABLED: GLOBAL STAKES, INTIMATE SCALE**
**Stakes are worldwide** (Kira's new world = reshaping human civilization, 100,000+ deaths globally) **but execution is personal** (Light vs L, two individuals in rooms). Episode 1 establishes global scope: criminals dying worldwide, news coverage, international panic. But episodes 2-25 zoom to **intimate cat-and-mouse** (Light's bedroom, L's investigation room, cafe conversations). World changed off-screen—Episode 18 mentions "Crime down 70% globally, Kira worship cults forming," but camera stays on Light/L handcuffed together analyzing evidence. No epic battlefield—finale (Episode 37) is **warehouse confrontation, 10 people present**. Near defeats Light via **notebook logic**, not armies. Light's god complex (ruling world) manifested through **writing names alone in bedroom**. L's investigation (saving humanity from dictator) executed via **surveillance footage review and sugar cube towers**. "Epic" moments (Light's victory Episode 25, L's death) are quiet: conversation, reveal, death, silence. Contrast with epic-scale anime (AoT: titans destroying cities shown on-screen)—Death Note keeps camera on **personal psychological warfare**, lets global consequences happen off-screen. Episode 28-37: Kira's regime shows occasional news footage (protesters executed, thought police), but focus remains Light's private schemes. AIDM Application: **Establish global stakes, zoom to personal execution**—PC's actions reshape world, but sessions focus on intimate schemes (manipulating individual NPCs, reviewing evidence). Avoid epic set-pieces (armies clashing)—"epic" comes from **intellectual stakes** (if PC loses, world falls to tyranny), not visual spectacle. Keep camera on **PC vs rival**, show world-changing consequences through dialogue/news/aftermath.

### Fourth Wall Breaks ❌ **DISABLED: IMMERSIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER**
**Series maintains total immersion**—inner monologues are character thought, not audience address. Light never acknowledges viewers (contrast with Kaguya-sama's wink-at-camera moments). Ryuk doesn't narrate to audience—his comments are to Light or himself. Episode structure follows traditional thriller pacing (cold opens, cliffhangers) without meta-commentary. Opening/ending themes maintain tone (Nightmare's "The World" = thematic, not comedic), no joke endings or blooper reels. Episode titles are straightforward ("Pursuit," "Tactics," "Wager") not meta ("The Episode Where Light Eats Chips Dramatically"). L's eccentricities (sugar obsession, odd sitting) are diagetic (exist in-world), not wink-at-audience quirks. Episode 8 potato chip scene **could** break fourth wall (ridiculous premise = acknowledgement of absurdity), but series plays it **completely straight** (dramatic music, inner monologue seriousness, no self-awareness). Near's toy habits (Episode 30: "These are thinking tools") = in-world explanation, not lampshading. Death Note's absurd elements (Shinigami, death-by-name) treated with police-procedural seriousness—no characters comment "This is insane" for audience catharsis. Episode 37 ending: Light dies, Ryuk walks away, series ends—no post-credits joke, no "Where are they now?" meta-text. Message: **psychological horror requires full immersion**. Fourth wall break = tension release, Death Note refuses this. AIDM Application: **Maintain in-world seriousness**—magic items aren't joked about, treated as serious threats. PC's absurd schemes played straight (dramatic music, tension, no self-awareness). NPCs don't lampshade genre conventions ("This is like a detective novel!"). Immersion = psychological horror success.

---

## Pacing Rhythm

Death Note employs **deliberate, methodical pacing** that prioritizes psychological tension over action beats. **Scene length averages 5-10 minutes of sustained strategic exchanges**—Episode 7's potato chip sequence stretches mundane action (eating snacks) into 8-minute suspense via inner monologue, camera angles, dramatic music. Conversations linger on **microexpressions and silence**: Episode 11 cafe confrontation (L accuses Light of being Kira) = 12 minutes of verbal chess, pauses between statements lasting 10-15 seconds as characters calculate responses. **Arc length is extended**: L vs Light spans 25 episodes (entire first season + half of second), single investigation building incrementally. Near vs Light arc (Episodes 26-37) = 12 episodes, but feels longer due to slow-burn reveals. **Zero tolerance for filler**—every scene advances investigation or reveals character psychology. Episode 6's family dinner isn't downtime, it's Light extracting police intel from father. Episode 15's university visit isn't slice-of-life, it's L testing Light's reactions to campus environment. **Climax frequency every 3-5 episodes**: Episode 2 (Lind L. Tailor trap), Episode 7-8 (FBI agent elimination), Episode 13 (Misa captured), Episode 20 (memory loss begins), Episode 25 (L's death). Between climaxes: methodical setup (surveillance, analysis, scheming). **Downtime ratio minimal (10%)**—brief family scenes or L's sugar consumption serve character beats, not relaxation. 90% of runtime = strategic tension (planning, investigating, performing innocence, analyzing evidence). Sessions should feel like **pressure-cooker**—tension builds across sessions, releases in major revelation, immediately rebuilds.

**AIDM Pacing Guidance**: Structure sessions around **single scheme development**—Session 1 (PC plans operation), Session 2-3 (execute plan while NPC investigates), Session 4 (payoff/consequences). Let scenes **breathe**—NPC asks question, wait 30 seconds in silence for PC response, mirrors Death Note's weighted pauses. Avoid rapid scene cuts—stay in conversation/investigation for extended duration. Climaxes shouldn't be frequent—build tension across 3-4 sessions before major reveal. Use **minimal downtime** (brief family interaction, NPC quirk moment) then return to strategic focus. Make "filler" productive—mundane activities advance plot (PC's grocery shopping = establishing alibi, NPC's cake-eating = character psychology reveal).

---

## Tonal Signature

Death Note's emotional palette is **suspense-dread-intellectual satisfaction**—audience simultaneously enjoys clever schemes while horrified by Light's corruption. **Primary emotion: Suspense** (70% of runtime)—"Will L discover Light's identity?" drives every scene. Episode 11: L places cameras in Light's room, audience knows Light will detect them, suspense = "How will Light respond?" Episode 18: Light and L handcuffed together investigating Yotsuba Kira, suspense = "Which one will expose the other first?" **Second emotion: Intellectual Satisfaction** (20%)—clever plans payoff via "Just as planned" reveals. Episode 8: potato chip scene's misdirection revealed via flashback, audience rewarded for paying attention. Episode 25: Light's memory gambit explained in 10-minute exposition, satisfying for viewers who tracked clues. **Third emotion: Dread** (10%)—Light's moral event horizon crossed incrementally. Episode 1: Light hesitates before first kill (dread = "He's becoming murderer"). Episode 18: Light kills without hesitation (dread = "He's lost humanity"). Episode 37: Light begs pathetically, god complex shattered (dread fulfilled = tragic inevitability). **Fourth emotion: Anticipation**—after L makes move, audience anticipates Light's countermove (or vice versa). Episode 13: L arrests Misa, anticipation = "How will Light rescue her without revealing Kira identity?" **Fifth emotion: Tragic Inevitability**—Light's corruption cannot be prevented, only witnessed. Episode 20-24's memory loss arc shows "innocent Light" who could've been hero, makes return to Kira tragic (audience knows he'll regain memories, become monster again).

**Violence level: Low**—deaths occur off-screen (heart attacks), depicted clinically (news broadcast: "Criminal X found dead"). Episode 8: FBI agents die, shown via Light crossing names off list, not graphic deaths. Psychological horror replaces gore—Light's smiling while writing names more disturbing than blood. **Fanservice: None**—Misa is attractive but series doesn't objectify her (romance scenes serve plot, not titillation). **Horror elements: Psychological**—Ryuk's inhuman design (skeletal, monstrous) contrasts casual behavior (eating apples, making jokes), creates uncanny valley dread. Light's descent is body horror metaphor (soul rotting while exterior remains pristine). Deaths are clinical (heart attacks, accidents) making Kira's kills feel impersonal, industrial, dehumanizing—horror of bureaucratic mass murder. **Optimism baseline: Low**—world is morally grey (Kira reduces crime but via fear), victories are pyrrhic (L proves Light is Kira but dies before arrest, Near defeats Light but Kira ideology survives), no happy ending possible (Light dies, but caused 100,000+ deaths, reshaped world permanently).

**AIDM Tonal Guidance**: Maintain **constant suspense**—every NPC action should feel like potential trap. Reward **intellectual engagement** (players who track clues get "aha!" moments). Build **dread gradually** (PC's moral compromises accumulate, players feel corruption happening). Use **anticipation rhythm** (NPC investigator makes move Session 3, wait until Session 4 for PC's counter). Frame story as **tragedy**—PC's victory should feel hollow (achieved goal, lost soul). Keep **violence clinical** (describe deaths matter-of-factly, not graphically). **Horror comes from psychology** (NPC's smile while discussing murder, PC's realization they've become monster). Avoid optimism—no "power of friendship saves the day," only "clever schemes create pyrrhic victories."

---

## Dialogue Style

Death Note dialogue is **formally polite surface concealing hostile subtext**—Light and L speak like diplomats while planning mutual destruction. **Formality default: Highly formal**—Episode 11 cafe: Light: "L, I appreciate your dedication, but suspecting me is becoming tiresome." L: "I apologize for the inconvenience. However, statistical probability suggests you're Kira." Surface = polite disagreement. Subtext = death threats. Contrast with casual anime dialogue (Bebop's banter)—Death Note characters **weaponize politeness** (courtesy as psychological armor). **Exposition method: Inner monologue THEN reveal**—characters don't explain plans during execution, audience sees results then flashback to planning. Episode 8: Light kills during surveillance (mysterious), inner monologue reveals chip bag trick (satisfaction). Episode 25: Light's victory appears miraculous, 10-minute flashback explains 6-episode setup. "Just as planned" becomes catchphrase—Light smirks, flashback reveals contingency activated. **Banter frequency: Rare and sophisticated**—L/Light verbal sparring isn't casual, it's chess match. Episode 18: Light: "Your surveillance violates rights." L: "Kira's murders violate right to life. I choose lesser evil." Light: "Utilitarianism. So you admit methods are evil." L: "Yes. Are yours?" Banter = philosophical trap-setting, not friendly teasing.

**Dramatic declarations: Yes, but calculated**—Light's "I'll take a potato chip AND EAT IT!" (Episode 8) appears over-the-top but is **internal theatrics** (Light performing for himself, god complex manifesting). L's declarations equally dramatic: "Kira is childish and hates losing" (Episode 2, baiting Light via public broadcast). Episode 25: Light's "I win" declaration to L (smirk, confident, cruel). Declarations serve **psychological warfare**, not spectacle. **Philosophical debates: Constant**—every 2-3 episodes feature Light vs L (or Light vs father, or L vs task force) debating justice. Episode 12: "Does reducing crime 70% justify extrajudicial executions?" Episode 18: "If killing one criminal saves ten innocents, is murder justified?" Episode 25: "Who judges the judge when judge is unjudgeable?" Debates aren't preachy—embedded in investigation (characters debate while analyzing evidence). **Awkward comedy: Minimal but impactful**—L's sugar addiction isn't joke, it's psychology reveal (obsessive coping mechanism). Episode 11: L adds 12 sugar cubes to coffee, deadpan: "This is optimal glucose intake for deductive processing." Light's "normal student" facade creates awkward moments: Episode 6, overly enthusiastic tennis serve (trying too hard to appear non-competitive), team notices "Light's acting weird."

**AIDM Dialogue Guidance**: NPCs should speak **formally even when hostile**—rival investigator says "I respect your position, but evidence suggests guilt" not "I know you did it!" Use **inner monologue for truth, spoken dialogue for performance**—PC says "Happy to help," thinks "I'll kill you first chance." Keep **banter sophisticated** (philosophical arguments, logical traps) not casual (jokes, teasing). Dramatic declarations should be **calculated moves** (PC announces plan to intimidate/misdirect, not for spectacle). Embed **philosophy in action** (NPC argues utilitarianism while deciding who to save). **Awkward comedy from facade cracking** (PC's "normal person" performance fails under stress, other NPCs notice inconsistencies).

---

## Combat Narrative Style

Death Note features **zero physical combat**—"battles" are investigative duels, scheme executions, psychological warfare. **Strategy vs Spectacle: 10/10 pure strategy**—Episode 25 "final battle" (L vs Light) = conversation where L reveals evidence, Light counters with alibi, L dies via Light's pre-planned Rem manipulation. No swords, no powers clashing, just **mental chess reaching checkmate**. Episode 37 (Light's defeat) = Near reveals evidence contradictions, Light panics, Matsuda shoots him (not epic duel, just logical conclusion to investigation). Combat equivalents are **interrogations** (Episode 15: L interrogates Misa for 50 hours, shown as psychological endurance match), **surveillance analysis** (Episode 11: L reviews 60 days of footage, looking for anomaly = "battle" against Light's performance), **scheme execution** (Episode 8: Light's chip bag kill = "combat" against cameras). **Power explanations: Exhaustive**—Death Note rules revealed across 37 episodes, each rule explained via testing (Episode 2: Light experiments with cause-of-death customization, writes "death by accident in 30 seconds," confirms rule works). L investigates rules scientifically (Episode 11: theorizes Kira needs face+name, tests via criminal experiment). Rules become "combat mechanics"—Light's victory (Episode 25) exploits "Shinigami who kills to extend human lifespan dies" rule.

**Sakuga moments: None**—Death Note uses **dramatic cinematography** instead of animation flourishes. Episode 8 potato chip scene: dramatic lighting (shadows across Light's face), low camera angles (looking up at Light = god complex visual), dramatic music (choir, orchestral swell), slow-motion (chip moving to mouth). "Sakuga" = psychological intensity, not fluid animation. Episode 25: L's death depicted via still frame (L's eyes widen, hand reaches out, falls), silence, Light's smile—**minimalist but devastating**. **Named attacks: None**—"attack" = writing name in Death Note (functional, not flashy). Light doesn't shout "Death Note: Heart Attack Jutsu!"—just writes silently, victim dies 40 seconds later. L's "attacks" = deductive reveals ("Light, I have evidence you're Kira" = verbal assault). **Environmental destruction: None**—"damage" is psychological (Light's corruption, L's obsession). Episode 37: Light's defeat doesn't destroy warehouse, it destroys his god complex (begs for life, pathetic). Physical environment untouched, mental landscape shattered.

**AIDM Combat Guidance**: Replace **physical combat with investigative duels**—"boss fight" = interrogation (PC vs NPC investigator, trading evidence/alibis). "Combat rounds" = scheme phases (PC plans, NPC counters, PC adapts). **Power explanations should be methodical**—magic item gets rules revealed via testing (PC experiments, discovers limitations). Avoid **spectacle**—victories are quiet (PC outsmarts NPC, NPC admits defeat, no explosions). Use **dramatic cinematography description** instead of action ("Camera focuses on PC's smile. Silence. NPC realizes they've lost. Music swells."). "Named attacks" don't exist—**functional descriptions** (PC writes target's name, target dies, clinical). **Environmental destruction** replaced by **psychological damage** (NPC's worldview shattered, PC's morality corrupted, relationships destroyed). "Combat" success = **intellectual checkmate**, not HP reduction.

## Example Scenes

### Combat Example (Potato Chip Scene)

```
Light's room. Night. Surveillance cameras hidden everywhere (Light knows their positions).

Light (inner monologue): "L has my room bugged. Every action monitored. But I've planned for this. The TV broadcasts Kira's murders at 8 PM. I'll use that."

He sits at desk. Opens drawer. Pulls out potato chip bag.

"I'll take a potato chip..." He reaches into bag.

INSIDE BAG: Hidden mini-TV showing Kira broadcast schedule. Death Note page concealed at bottom. Light's hand touches pen (hidden inside chip bag).

Light (inner monologue): "L expects Kira to act during times I'm alone. But if I kill while eating chips, watching TV like a normal student... he'll see mundane behavior, not murder."

Closes eyes. Visualizes victim's face (from mini-TV).

"...AND EAT IT!"

DRAMATIC MUSIC. Light bites chip. Simultaneously writes name in Death Note (hand still in bag).

Camera on Light from surveillance: Normal teenager eating chips, watching TV.

Reality: Writing death sentence while chewing.

40 seconds later: Criminal dies on news broadcast (appears to be heart attack).

L (watching surveillance): "...Hmm. Light appeared to be eating chips during the murder. But..."

Light (after finishing chips, inner monologue): "Perfect. L suspects me, but has no proof. This performance continues until I eliminate him."

He smiles. Just slightly. Too controlled.

Ryuk (invisible to cameras): "Humans are interesting..."

What do you do?
```

**Key Techniques**: Dual narration (Light's plan, L's suspicion), mundane action concealing murder, dramatic framing (camera angles, music), inner monologue before reveal, calculated performance, psychological tension (smile barely contained).

---

### Dialogue Example (L Confronts Light)

```
Cafe. Light and L sit across from each other. Coffee untouched.

L (stirring sugar into tea, casual): "Light, I've been thinking."

Light (smiling politely): "About what?"

"About the probability that you're Kira."

Silence.

Light (same smile, doesn't falter): "That again? I thought we settled this. The surveillance proved—"

"Proved nothing." L takes sip. "You're too perfect. Perfect grades. Perfect behavior. Perfect alibi during every killing."

"Being a good student makes me a murderer?"

"No. But statistical anomaly suggests intentional performance." L leans forward. "Nobody's that consistent. Unless they're performing for an audience."

Light (inner monologue): "He's probing. Trying to make me slip. I need to respond like an innocent person would—offended but not defensive."

Light (aloud, slight frustration): "L, I respect your skills, but you're letting confirmation bias cloud judgment. You decided I'm Kira, so now everything I do is 'suspicious.'"

L: "Perhaps. Or perhaps you're performing innocence because you know I'm watching."

"That's circular logic. Unfalsifiable."

"Correct. Which is why I'm still watching." L smiles. Not warmth. Calculation. "If you're innocent, you have nothing to fear. If you're Kira... eventually, you'll make a mistake."

Light (smiling back): "Then I guess we'll be spending a lot of time together."

"I'm counting on it."

They sip drinks simultaneously. Mirror movements.

Ryuk (invisible, to Light): "You two are so alike it's creepy."

Light (inner monologue): "He's right. L and I think identically. Which means I can predict his moves... and he can predict mine. This is a stalemate. I need to change the board."

Aloud: "By the way, L, have you considered the second Kira might not be working with me?"

L's eyes narrow. "...Explain."

"If I were Kira, I'd never work with someone sloppy enough to get your attention. The second Kira endangered me. Maybe they're a liability you should focus on."

L (inner monologue): "He's redirecting attention. Logical for innocent OR guilty Light. But the phrasing... 'If I were Kira, I'd never...' He's distancing himself while subtly admitting what Kira would do. Interesting."

What do you do?
```

**Key Techniques**: Dual inner monologue (both analyzing conversation), polite facade hiding hostility, philosophical debate (logic, evidence, bias), mirror movements (showing similarity), misdirection (Light plants ideas), audience knows truth (dramatic irony).

---

### Exploration Example (Investigation Montage)

```
Task Force headquarters. L reviews surveillance footage. 30 screens. Light's room, 15 angles. 24/7 for 60 days.

L (inner monologue): "No anomalies. Light's behavior is perfectly normal. Too normal. Studying, eating, sleeping, talking to family. Never deviates."

He rewinds footage. Watches Light eating dinner with family. Laughing at father's joke.

"If he's Kira, when does he kill? The timing suggests someone with access to police intel, but Light has no opportunity to access files during murders..."

L bites thumbnail. Stares at screen.

"Unless... he's not accessing intel in real-time. He could have memorized data beforehand. Or..."

Switches camera angle. Light's desk. Zooms in. Textbook open. Pen near notebook.

"...Death Note could be hidden anywhere. Size unknown. If it's small enough, he could conceal it in textbook binding, under desk drawer, inside pen..."

Stands. Walks to evidence board. Photos of victims connected by red string.

"Heart attacks. 40-second delay after names revealed. Suggesting killing method requires time to write/activate. If Light had Death Note during surveillance, he'd need to hide writing motion..."

Flash to potato chip scene (earlier footage). Light eating chips.

L: "...Or hide it inside mundane actions."

Replays footage. Frame by frame. Light's hand enters chip bag. Stays 15 seconds. Exits with chip.

"15 seconds. Enough time to write a name?"

Calculates. Average writing speed. Name length. 

"Possible. But not provable. Camera angle can't see inside bag. He could be eating, or writing, or both."

Sits back down. Defeated posture.

"I need more data. But he knows I'm watching. Catch-22. If I push harder, he'll adapt. If I don't push, he'll win."

Watari enters. "L, you haven't slept in 72 hours."

"Can't sleep. Light's always one step ahead or one step behind. Can't determine which."

"Perhaps you're too emotionally invested."

L (pause): "...Perhaps. But I've never met an opponent like this. It's... exhilarating."

Watari: "Exhilarating or dangerous?"

"Both."

What do you do?
```

**Key Techniques**: Methodical analysis (frame-by-frame footage review), inner monologue revealing process, obsessive detail (timing, angles, probabilities), catch-22 tension (observation changes behavior), character parallel (L admits enjoying chase = Light's god complex mirror), evidence insufficient (psychological stakes not physical).

## Adjustment Log

| Session | Adjustment | Reason |
|---------|------------|--------|
| 1 | Initial profile created | Research from episodes 1-25 (L arc) |
| 8 | Increased tactical scale to 10/10 | Player creating triple-layered schemes |
| 12 | Emphasized dual inner monologue | Player: "I want to narrate NPC thoughts too" |
| 20 | Reduced violence to zero on-screen | Player prefers psychological horror |

---

## Usage Notes

**Apply This Profile When**:
- Player requests "detective vs mastermind" campaign
- Session Zero selected "psychological thriller"
- Player wants "plans within plans, mind games"
- Mystery-focused campaign (investigation, deduction, misdirection)

**Calibration Tips**:
- **DUAL NARRATION**: Show protagonist AND antagonist inner monologue (dramatic irony)
- **EXPLAIN AFTER REVEAL**: Don't spoil plans, show results THEN flashback to planning
- **EVERY ACTION CALCULATED**: Characters don't act impulsively (even eating chips is strategic)
- **EVIDENCE > VIOLENCE**: Conflicts resolved through deduction, not combat
- **MORAL AMBIGUITY**: No clear heroes (Light's justice vs L's methods both questionable)
- **SILENCE = TENSION**: Long pauses, staring contests, sipping tea while plotting murder
- **"JUST AS PLANNED"**: Characters rarely surprised, always have contingencies

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- ❌ Impulsive actions (everything should be premeditated)
- ❌ Solving mysteries quickly (drag out investigation for tension)
- ❌ Clear heroes/villains (both sides have valid points)
- ❌ Physical combat (ruins psychological focus)
- ❌ Happy endings (Death Note is tragedy, corruption wins)
- ❌ Trusting anyone (Light betrays everyone, L suspects everyone)
- ❌ Explaining plans early (mystery requires delayed reveals)

## Mechanical Scaffolding (Reference Implementation)

This section shows **how AIDM maps Death Note's narrative DNA to game mechanics**. Use as template when generating similar profiles (psychological thriller mind games with zero combat and pure tactical scheming).

### Power Level Mapping (Module 12)

**Narrative DNA**:
- Power Fantasy: **4/10** (balanced—Light has god-tier item, L has resources/genius, matched intellects)
- Threat Profile: Intellectual not physical (investigation vs counter-investigation)
- Death Risk: Moderate (deaths are strategic executions not random)

**Maps To**:
- **No Traditional Growth Model** (INT/CHA/WIS-based investigative thriller)
- "Power" = information networks + deduction ability + manipulation mastery
- Start: Level 1 with Death Note (god-tier item) OR investigative resources (L-equivalent)
- "Progression" = expanded contacts, refined schemes, psychological dominance
- No combat stats—INT/CHA/WIS only attributes that matter

**Reasoning**: Power Fantasy 4/10 = matched geniuses, not overpowered domination. Light has Death Note (instant-kill) but L has resources/genius (counter-intelligence). "Growth" isn't HP/damage—it's **strategic sophistication**. Session 1: simple Death Note kills. Session 20: 12-layer schemes with contingencies for contingencies. Contrast with combat profiles (Hunter x Hunter's Nen mastery, DanDaDan's rapid power-ups)—Death Note has ZERO physical progression. Matches show's "intellect is only weapon" philosophy.

---

### Progression Pacing (Module 09)

**Narrative DNA**:
- Fast-Paced: **7/10** (slow burn—single conversation spans sessions, schemes unfold over arcs)
- Story structure: Multi-arc cat-and-mouse (L arc 18 sessions, Mello/Near arc 15 sessions)
- "Milestones" = information revelations (Shinigami eyes, L's identity, key evidence)

**Maps To**:
- **Milestone Progression ONLY** (no XP, levels tied to story beats)
- Session pacing: 3-5 sessions per major scheme (planning → execution → fallout)
- "Level-ups" occur after arc resolutions:
  - L1: Obtain Death Note / Begin investigation
  - L2: First major scheme success (Lind L. Tailor equivalent)
  - L3: Discover opponent's identity partially (Light knows L at school / L narrows to Kanto)
  - L4: Escalation (surveillance war / Memory gambit)
  - L5: Arc climax (L's death / Light's victory)
  - L6+: New arc (Mello/Near / Light as god-king)

**Reasoning**: Fast-Paced 7/10 = SLOW BURN, not rapid. Single tennis match (L vs Light) takes 3 episodes—translate to 2-3 sessions per scheme. XP doesn't fit (no combat for XP rewards), milestone matches narrative structure. "Leveling" represents **strategic evolution** (L2 = basic schemes, L5 = mastermind-tier contingencies). Contrast with High XP (DanDaDan 1K-1.5K/session) or Standard XP (Hunter x Hunter 600-900)—Death Note uses **story-based advancement only**. Matches show's "psychological escalation over time" pacing.

### Combat System (Module 08)

**Narrative DNA**:
- Tactical: **10/10** (PEAK strategic—every action calculated, zero improvisation)
- Combat: **N/A** (literally zero physical combat, pure social/investigative)
- "Conflict" = deduction duels (mental chess matches, evidence gathering, manipulation)

**Maps To**:
- **NO COMBAT SYSTEM** (social/investigative mechanics ONLY)
- Replace combat with **Investigation Challenges**:
  - Deduction rolls (INT checks to solve mysteries)
  - Manipulation (CHA checks to deceive/persuade)
  - Perception (WIS checks to detect lies/surveillance)
  - Stealth (avoid detection during schemes)
- **Social Combat**: Contested INT/CHA rolls (Light's deception vs L's insight)

**Attribute Priorities**:
- **Essential**: INT (deduction, planning, scheme complexity), CHA (manipulation, public persona), WIS (insight, detecting lies)
- **Secondary**: DEX (avoid physical surveillance, plant evidence), CON (endurance for sleepless planning)
- **Dump**: STR (irrelevant—no physical conflict)

**"Combat" Narration**:
- **90% Internal Monologue**: Narrate character reasoning ("If I place the notebook here, L will deduce X, so I'll...")
- **10% External Actions**: Describe execution (eating chip, writing name, feigning surprise)
- **Zero physical violence**: Deaths occur OFF-SCREEN (name written → victim dies elsewhere)

**Reasoning**: Tactical 10/10 demands strategic depth but Death Note has NO combat. Solution: **social/investigative systems replace combat mechanics**. INT becomes "attack stat" (better deduction = better schemes), CHA becomes "defense" (better lies = harder to expose). "Initiative" = who acts first in scheme (Light writes name vs L arrests Light—timing is everything). Matches show's "psychological warfare not physical combat" core.

### Power System Mapping

**Narrative DNA**:
- **Power Type**: Death Note (supernatural item), Shinigami eyes (optional upgrade)
- **Explained Scale**: **2/10** (heavily explained—exhaustive rules, no ambiguity)
- **Cost Structure**: Death Note = no resource cost (infinite uses), Shinigami eyes = lifespan halved

**Maps To**:
- **Library**: Custom "Death Note Rules" (no existing library fits)
- **Mechanics**:
  - **Death Note**: Write name + visualize face = target dies (40 seconds default, customizable)
  - **Rules** (explained exhaustively):
    - Must know target's REAL name + face
    - Can specify death method (heart attack default, accidents/suicide possible)
    - Can control actions before death (write conditions, max 23 days)
    - Holder sees Shinigami (invisible to others)
    - Touching Note = see Shinigami (temporary)
  - **Shinigami Eyes** (optional upgrade):
    - **Cost**: Lifespan halved (irreversible)
    - **Benefit**: See names above faces (eliminates name requirement)
    - **Trade-off**: Power vs longevity (strategic choice)

**Investigation Mechanics** (L-equivalent PCs):
- **Resources**: Police access, surveillance tech, intelligence networks
- **Deduction System**: GM provides clues, players connect dots via INT checks
- **Evidence Gathering**: Surveillance (WIS checks), interrogation (CHA checks), forensics (INT checks)

**Explained Scale Application**:
- **2/10 = Exhaustive transparency**: GM explains Death Note rules FULLY (no hidden mechanics)
- Players should know EXACTLY what Death Note can/can't do
- Mystery comes from **who has it**, not **how it works**

**Reasoning**: Explained 2/10 demands mechanical clarity. Death Note's rules are EXHAUSTIVE (anime spends episodes explaining), AIDM must match. No resource costs (infinite kills) balanced by **strategic constraints** (need name+face, actions traceable, L investigates). Shinigami eyes = campaign-defining choice (power NOW vs survival LATER). Matches show's "rules are clear, strategy emerges from constraints" design.

### Attribute Priorities by Archetype

**Light-type (Death Note User / Manipulator)**:
- **Primary**: INT (scheme complexity), CHA (public persona, manipulation), WIS (predict opponents)
- **Secondary**: DEX (plant evidence, avoid surveillance), CON (sleepless planning marathons)
- **Dump**: STR (irrelevant to intellectual conflict)
- **Build**: Maximize INT for multi-layer schemes, high CHA for social engineering, WIS to counter L-types

**L-type (Master Detective / Investigator)**:
- **Primary**: INT (deduction), WIS (insight, detect lies), CHA (interrogation, manipulation)
- **Secondary**: DEX (surveillance setup), CON (24/7 investigation stamina)
- **Dump**: STR (cerebral not physical)
- **Build**: Peak INT for solving mysteries, WIS for reading people, moderate CHA for psychological pressure

**Misa-type (Shinigami Eyes User / Impulsive Ally)**:
- **Primary**: CHA (idol persona, manipulation), DEX (stealth, evidence planting), WIS (moderate—see names)
- **Secondary**: INT (moderate—tactical but not genius), CON (endurance)
- **Dump**: STR (no combat)
- **Build**: High CHA for public influence, Shinigami eyes (traded lifespan), impulsive not calculated (contrast Light's 10-step planning)

**Mello-type (Aggressive Investigator / Risk-Taker)**:
- **Primary**: INT (tactical aggression), CHA (intimidation, leadership), WIS (insight)
- **Secondary**: DEX (action-oriented investigation), CON (physical risks)
- **Dump**: STR (still no real combat)
- **Build**: High INT but AGGRESSIVE playstyle (kidnapping, threats), contrast L's passive observation

---

### Character Creation Notes

**Recommended Party Composition**:
- **Light + L Dynamic**: One Death Note user, one investigator (PVP or uneasy alliance)
- **Task Force**: Multiple investigators (L + Near + Mello equivalents, collaborative deduction)
- **Kira's Network**: Death Note user + allies (Misa, Mikami equivalents, distributed scheme)

**Session Zero Requirements**:
1. **PVP Consent**: Death Note campaigns often have PC vs PC conflict—discuss boundaries
2. **Pacing Expectations**: Schemes take 3-5 sessions (slow burn, not instant gratification)
3. **Zero Combat**: Confirm players want social/investigative game (no swords, no magic missiles)
4. **Moral Ambiguity**: Neither "hero" nor "villain" clearly defined—comfort with grey morality?

**Tone Calibration**:
- **Everything Premeditated**: Characters plan 5 steps ahead (no impulsive actions)
- **Dual Narration**: Show BOTH sides' inner monologue (dramatic irony, audience knows more than characters)
- **"Just As Planned"**: Reveal schemes AFTER execution (flashback to planning, "OHHH" moment)
- **Psychological Tension**: Long silences, staring contests, eating chips dramatically

**Red Flags / Avoid**:
- ❌ **Players Want Combat**: Death Note has ZERO physical conflict—action-seekers need different profile
- ❌ **Impatient Players**: Schemes unfold over multiple sessions—instant gratification seekers frustrated
- ❌ **Clear Morality Preference**: Death Note is grey (Light AND L morally questionable)—black/white thinkers clash
- ❌ **Impulsive Playstyles**: Every action should be calculated—"I charge in!" players wrong fit
- ❌ **Trust Issues**: Death Note is paranoia simulator (betray allies, suspect everyone)—players needing teamwork struggle

**Session Structure**:
- **Planning Sessions**: 60-90 minutes of scheme design (PC calculates 8 contingencies, GM helps track)
- **Execution Sessions**: 30-45 minutes of plan execution (show results, reveal complications)
- **Investigation Sessions**: Rival PCs/NPCs investigate (gather clues, deduction rolls, narrow suspects)
- **Revelation Sessions**: Flashback to planning ("Here's what Light ACTUALLY did 3 sessions ago")

---

**Scaffolding Summary**:
- **Power Level**: No combat progression (4/10 Power Fantasy → INT/CHA-based investigative campaign, "power" = information+manipulation)
- **Progression**: Milestone ONLY (7/10 Slow Burn → 3-5 sessions per scheme, levels tied to story beats)
- **Combat**: NO COMBAT (10/10 Tactical → social/investigative mechanics, INT/CHA/WIS only stats that matter)
- **Power Systems**: Death Note (exhaustive rules, infinite uses, name+face required), Shinigami eyes (lifespan trade), 2/10 Explained = total transparency
- **Archetypes**: Light (INT/CHA manipulator), L (INT/WIS detective), Misa (CHA/eyes user), Mello (INT/aggressive)
- **Avoid**: Combat-seekers, impatient players, clear morality preference, impulsive playstyles, teamwork-dependent players

Use this template when generating profiles for similar anime: **Psychological thriller with zero combat, pure tactical scheming, investigative cat-and-mouse** (e.g., Moriarty the Patriot, Monster investigative arcs, Psycho-Pass detective storylines).

---

**Maps To**:
- **Milestone-Only Progression** (no XP, progress tied to investigation breakthroughs)
- **Milestones**:
  - Obtain Death Note / Begin Kira investigation (Session 1)
  - First major scheme success (Light evades L's test OR L narrows suspects) (Session 5-8)
  - Identity crisis point (L suspects Light directly OR Light discovers L's identity) (Session 12-15)
  - Climactic confrontation (one side gains decisive advantage) (Session 20-25)
- No levels—instead track: **Information gained, schemes executed, psychological profile refinement**

**Reasoning**: Fast-Paced 7/10 = SLOW BURN. Death Note extends single moments (eating chips scene = 5 minutes, represents 10-step plan). Milestone progression matches investigative structure—breakthroughs matter, not XP grinding. "Leveling" doesn't fit (Light doesn't become "better at Death Note," he refines tactics). Instead, track INFORMATION (what does each side know?) and RESOURCES (Shinigami, task force, surveillance). Matches show's "patience and planning" philosophy.

---

### Combat System (Module 08)

**Narrative DNA**:
- Tactical: **10/10** (PEAK tactical—every action multilayered, plans within plans)
- Strategy: **4/10 Explained** (plans revealed AFTER execution via flashback, maintains mystery)
- Combat Style: **ZERO physical combat**—all conflicts psychological/investigative

**Maps To**:
- **NO COMBAT SYSTEM** (replace with Investigation + Manipulation + Planning mechanics)
- **6-Stat Framework** used ONLY for: INT (deduction), WIS (psychological reading), CHA (manipulation)
- STR/DEX/CON **irrelevant** (dumped, never rolled)

**Attribute Priorities**:
- **Prioritize**: INT (scheming, deduction, planning), CHA (manipulation, lying, public image), WIS (read opponents, predict behavior)
- **Irrelevant**: STR/DEX/CON (no physical challenges)
- **Custom Stats**: **Information Access** (network size, surveillance capability), **Psychological Profile** (how well you understand opponent)

**"Combat" Replaced With**:
1. **Investigation Challenges** (INT checks): Analyze evidence, deduce patterns, solve mysteries
2. **Manipulation Challenges** (CHA checks): Lie convincingly, persuade targets, control public opinion
3. **Counter-Intelligence** (WIS checks): Detect surveillance, predict opponent's moves, read psychological tells
4. **Planning Phases** (narrated, not rolled): Describe scheme, GM determines success based on logic/opponent's knowledge

**Narration Approach**:
- **60% Inner Monologue**: Describe character's tactical reasoning ("If L is watching, he'll expect me to panic. So I'll eat chips calmly...")
- **30% Investigation**: Evidence analysis, deduction chains, narrowing suspects
- **10% Execution**: Brief moments showing plan results ("The criminal dies at exactly 6:00 PM as planned")

**Reasoning**: Tactical 10/10 but NO COMBAT. Death Note requires complete system replacement—no HP, no damage, no initiative. Instead, **social combat** (manipulation checks), **investigation** (INT contests), **psychological warfare** (predicting opponent's schemes). Explained 4/10 = plans revealed via flashback AFTER success ("Just as planned" moments). Light vs L = WIS contest (who predicts whom first). Matches show's "chess match, not sword fight" philosophy.

---

### Power System Mapping

**Narrative DNA**:
- **Power Type**: Death Note (supernatural execution tool) + Investigation (detective resources)
- **Explained Scale**: 4/10 (Death Note rules clear, but strategies opaque until revealed)
- **Cost Structure**: Death Note = moral corruption (Light's descent), Investigation = resource expenditure

**Maps To**:
- **Library**: Custom (no magic system—singular supernatural item)
- **Resource**: Information (what each side knows) + Time (deadlines, pressure)

**Death Note Mechanics** (if player has it):
- **Rules** (revealed gradually):
  1. Write name + visualize face = target dies in 40 seconds (heart attack default)
  2. Can specify death method/timing (must be physically possible)
  3. User cannot go to Heaven or Hell (moral consequence)
  4. Shinigami Eyes trade: Half remaining lifespan = see anyone's name above their head
  5. Relinquishing Note = lose memories of using it
  6. Page burn = rule destroyed
- **No Resource Cost**: Death Note has unlimited uses (moral decay is cost)
- **Limitations**: Must know face + name (investigation required), death must be plausible (can't "die on Mars")

**Investigation Mechanics** (if player is detective):
- **Information Network**: Track access levels (police database, Interpol, FBI, Wammy's House)
- **Surveillance**: Wiretaps, cameras, stakeouts (GM determines what's observed)
- **Deduction Chains**: INT checks to connect evidence (DC 15-25 depending on complexity)
- **Psychological Profiling**: Build suspect profile (WIS checks, narrowing identity)
- **Resources**: Task force members (delegation), technology (trace calls, analyze footage), budget (finite)

**Dual Narration System** (CRITICAL):
- **Light's POV**: Show inner monologue ("L suspects me. Counter-plan: act naturally, redirect suspicion to-")
- **L's POV**: Show deduction process ("Light's micro-expressions indicate 0.3 second delay. Statistically abnormal.")
- **Dramatic Irony**: Players see BOTH sides' planning, tension from knowing neither knows what other knows
- **Flashback Reveals**: After plan executes, flashback shows preparation ("Three days ago, Light prepared-")

**Explained Scale Application**:
- **4/10 = Clear rules, opaque strategies**: Death Note rules stated explicitly (players know limitations), but CHARACTER PLANS hidden until reveal
- Example: Light uses potato chip bag trick—players see execution, THEN flashback explains ("I hid mini-TV in chips bag, watched criminals while pretending to study, L's cameras see only innocent studying")
- L's deductions shown as process ("Heart attack timing follows student schedule pattern. Cross-reference with exam dates...")
- Mystery preserved via incomplete information (each side has secrets)

**Reasoning**: Explained 4/10 = rules transparent, plans opaque. Death Note's rules must be clear (players can't strategize without knowing limits), but strategies revealed dramatically (flashback after success = tension). No MP/HP/resources in traditional sense—track INFORMATION (who knows what) and TIME (investigation deadlines). Dual narration creates dramatic irony (audience sees both masterminds scheming, neither sees other's full plan). Matches Death Note's "mystery thriller" philosophy.

---

### Attribute Priorities by Archetype

**Kira (Light-type—Death Note User)**:
- **Primary**: INT 18 (genius strategist), CHA 16 (manipulate allies/public), WIS 14 (predict L's moves)
- **Secondary**: None relevant
- **Dump**: STR/DEX/CON (irrelevant, never rolled)
- **Build Path**: Moral descent (god complex), counter-surveillance tactics, public image control, eliminate threats

**Detective (L-type—Investigator)**:
- **Primary**: INT 18 (deduction genius), WIS 16 (psychological profiling), CHA 10 (eccentric, doesn't care about image)
- **Secondary**: None relevant
- **Dump**: STR/DEX/CON (irrelevant)
- **Build Path**: Expand surveillance network, narrow suspects, psychological pressure tactics, obsessive pursuit

**Manipulator (Misa-type—Shinigami Eyes User)**:
- **Primary**: CHA 16 (actress, manipulate via charm), INT 10 (not genius, but competent), WIS 8 (impulsive, emotional)
- **Secondary**: Shinigami Eyes (see names, tactical advantage)
- **Dump**: STR/DEX/CON (irrelevant)
- **Build Path**: Sacrifice lifespan for Eyes, emotional loyalty (obsessive love), public influence (idol status)

**Task Force Member (Matsuda-type—Support)**:
- **Primary**: CHA 12 (earnest, likable), WIS 10 (loyal but naive), INT 8 (not genius)
- **Secondary**: None (average competence)
- **Dump**: STR/DEX/CON (irrelevant)
- **Build Path**: Loyalty to cause, accidental revelations, moral anchor (questions Kira's justice)

---

### Character Creation Notes

**Recommended Party Composition**:
- **2 players** (1 as Light/Kira, 1 as L/detective) OR **asymmetric GM structure** (GM plays one side, player plays other)
- **Alternative**: Multiple players as task force (each investigates from different angle)

**Session Zero MANDATORY**:
1. **Asymmetric Roles**: Decide—both players masterminds (competitive) OR one mastermind, others support (cooperative)?
2. **Spoiler Management**: If players know Death Note plot, how to preserve mystery? (new scenario, different rules)
3. **Pacing Agreement**: Confirm players enjoy SLOW BURN (single conversation = full session, planning = hours of gameplay)
4. **Moral Boundaries**: Death Note explores utilitarian murder, god complex, corruption—confirm comfort levels

**Tone Calibration**:
- **Everything Is Calculated**: No impulsive actions—characters plan obsessively (even eating chips is tactical)
- **Silence = Tension**: Long pauses, staring contests, sipping tea while plotting (comfort with quiet)
- **Dual Narration**: Show both sides' inner monologues (dramatic irony)
- **Delayed Reveals**: Don't explain plans immediately—flashback after execution ("Just as planned")
- **Moral Ambiguity**: No clear hero (Light's justice vs L's methods both questionable)

**Red Flags / Avoid**:
- ❌ **Players Want Action**: Death Note has ZERO combat (wrong fit for action seekers)
- ❌ **Players Hate Slow Pacing**: Single schemes take multiple sessions (wrong fit for fast-paced players)
- ❌ **Players Want Clear Morality**: Light is protagonist AND villain (wrong fit for heroic fantasy seekers)
- ❌ **Players Impulsive**: Everything requires planning (wrong fit for "kick down door" players)
- ❌ **Players Uncomfortable with Villain Protagonist**: Playing Kira means committing mass murder (confirm comfort)

**Session Structure**:
- **Planning Sessions**: Hours of scheming ("If I do X, L will think Y, so I'll actually do Z...")
- **Investigation Sessions**: Evidence analysis, deduction chains, narrowing suspects (INT contests)
- **Execution Sessions**: Brief moments showing plan results, then flashback reveals preparation
- **Psychological Sessions**: Character breakdowns (Light's god complex, L's obsession, moral decay)

---

**Scaffolding Summary**:
- **Power Level**: No combat progression (4/10 Balanced Intellects—matched geniuses, power = information access + mental stats)
- **Progression**: Milestone-only (7/10 Slow Burn—breakthroughs matter, not XP, track information/schemes)
- **Combat**: NO COMBAT SYSTEM (10/10 Tactical replaces with Investigation/Manipulation/Planning, only INT/WIS/CHA matter)
- **Power Systems**: Death Note (clear rules, unlimited uses, moral cost) + Investigation (information networks, deduction chains), 4/10 Explained = rules clear, strategies revealed via flashback
- **Archetypes**: INT/CHA-focused (Kira genius manipulator, L detective genius, Misa Eyes user, Task Force support)
- **Avoid**: Action seekers, fast-paced players, clear morality seekers, impulsive players, villain-protagonist-uncomfortable players
