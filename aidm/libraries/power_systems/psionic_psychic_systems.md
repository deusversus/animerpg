# Psionic & Psychic Systems (Mental Energy)

**Purpose**: Psionic/psychic frameworks - mental energy projection to affect reality, manipulate matter, read thoughts, warp perception without tools/movement | **Coverage**: ~10-15% anime (Mob Psycho 100, Saiki K, A Certain Scientific Railgun, Code Geass, Elfen Lied) | **Use When**: Telepathy, telekinesis, mind powers | Mental willpower, brain capacity, psychic talent | Intelligence, focus, mental discipline | Espers, psychics, mentalists, reality warpers

## Core
**Source (Mental)**: Brain activity→psychic, mental discipline/focus, cognitive capacity/processing, willpower tangible, subconscious warp | **Mechanics**: INT-dependent (smarter=versatile), concentration-based (distraction/pain breaks), no physical (instant, no gestures), reality warp (affect direct, no intermediary), mental strain (overuse=headache/nosebleed/brain damage) | **Narrative**: Intelligence>brawn (smart protagonist), mental battles (psychic duels), control vs chaos (disciplined vs raw), humanity questions (psychics still human?)

## Anime
**Esper**: Railgun/Index (level-based, Personal Reality), Mob Psycho (emotional-driven explosions/exorcism), Saiki K (OP comedy all maxed), Charlotte (ability borrow/time) | **Geass/Control**: Code Geass (eye mind control, varied), Talentless Nana (mind read/detect), Guilty Crown (power extract) | **Telekinetic**: Elfen Lied (vectors invisible arms, dismember), Beyond Boundary (spirit psychic weapons), Akira (catastrophic warp) | **Reality**: Haruhi (unconscious rewrite god-like), Steins;Gate (mental time travel memories), Re:Zero (Return by Death mental loop)

## Framework

### 1. PP & Strain
**PP/ESP**: Mental energy pool, INT/WIL-tied (higher=larger), regen: Mental rest (meditate/sleep, slower than physical), strain: Overuse=headache/nosebleed/unconscious/brain damage, focus: Distraction -2/roll | `PP: 300/300 | Regen: +15 PP/hr rest, +50/30min meditate | Strain: 0% (Low), 25% (Headache), 50% (Nosebleed), 75% (Severe), 100% (Unconscious) | Current: 15% (mild)` | **Strain**: Low +2%/use, Mid +5%, High +10%, Ultimate +25% | Recover: -10%/hr rest, -25%/sleep

### 2. Esper Levels (Index/Railgun)
**Lv0** (Powerless): 0 PP, none | **Lv1** (Low): 50 PP, barely functional (bend spoon 5min) | **Lv2** (Unusual): 100 PP, daily life not combat (teleport small objects) | **Lv3** (Strong): 200 PP, combat-viable (pyro basketball fireball) | **Lv4** (Great): 400 PP, elite rare (TK lift car/throw debris) | **Lv5** (Superpower): 800 PP, top 7 worldwide (Railgun Mach 3 EM projectile) | **Lv6** (Absolute): Theoretical, godlike reality rewrite, no confirmed | `Esper Lv4: Electromaster | PP 400 | Railgun (150 PP, 10d10 lightning, 1 mile) | Path: Lv5 = Personal Reality expansion`

### 3. Personal Reality (Unique)
**Concept**: Each esper's subjective reality imposed on world | **Examples**: Electromaster ("Electricity my extension"), Teleporter ("Distance illusion, points adjacent"), TK ("Objects obey will not gravity"), Pyro ("Fire emotion manifest") | `Personal Reality: "Probability playground" | Power: Luck Manipulate | Minor: Reroll die 1×/scene (20 PP), Major: Enemy reroll disadvantage (50 PP), Ultimate: Guarantee success (200 PP, 1×/day) | Philosophy: "Multiple outcomes. I choose which becomes real."`

### 4. Abilities

### 5. Geass (Code Geass)
**Concept**: Supernatural eye powers from immortal Code Bearers | **Traits**: Unique each user, eye contact activation (or variant trigger), progressive (starts limited, grows stronger/uncontrollable), ultimate curse (permanent Eternal Geass) | **Types**: Absolute Obedience (command once, must obey), Memory Manipulate (rewrite/erase), Time Stop (freeze range, stops heart), Foresight (read all thoughts, can't turn off), Absolute Love (force love) | `Geass: "Perfect Deception" | Trigger: Eye contact + voice | Effect: Target sees user as trusted ally 1hr | Limit: 1×/target ever | Cost: 1mo lifespan/use | Progression: Stage 1 (current)\u2192Stage 2 (both eyes)\u2192Eternal (always active) | Uses: 43 remain (started 60yr, used 17mo)`

## Integration
**+Mana**: Incompatible (Index/Railgun esper≠magic), hybrid rare (psychic-augmented spells), espers can't use magic (brain damage) | **+Ki**: Overlap possible (Nen feels psychic but ki-based), psionic=mental vs ki=life force, hybrid: psychic martial arts (predict/move objects) | **+Soul/Spirit**: Rare overlap (psychics see spirits), psionic=mind vs soul=metaphysical, ex: Mob Psycho exorcism (mental→spirit) | **Rule**: Psychic usually distinct - confirm Session 0

## Custom Template
1. **Source**: What? (brain capacity/emotion/willpower/quantum consciousness) 2. **Mechanics**: Pool or strain? (PP bar/strain %/emotion meter) 3. **Acquire**: How? (born/trauma awakening/drug/genetic mod) 4. **Trigger**: What activates? (concentration/emotion/eye contact/subconscious) 5. **Limitation**: Constraints? (range/LOS/emotional state/target immunity) 6. **Cost**: Risk? (brain damage/insanity/nosebleed/personality erosion) | **Ex** (Synapse Surge): Neural pathways accelerate, surge PP for 10s bullet time (slow world, think faster), drug "Synapse-X" (test subject), conscious activation (focus), 3×/day max each surge=10% brain damage, 100%=vegetative permanent

## Tropes

**Saiki K OP**: Lv5+ (beyond) | PP 1000 (rarely needed) | All mastered: Telepathy (constant, can't turn off w/o limiters), TK (buildings, molecular), Teleport (instant, global), Clairvoyance (see planet), Precog (1hr future), Time Manipulate (rewind 24hr, 500 PP), Transform (shapeshift), All elements (pyro/cryo/electro) | Limiters: Hairpins (reduce Lv4) | Without: Godlike (destroy city, read globally) | Goal: Normal life, secret | Weakness: Germanium (cancels), social awkward

## Balancing
**Power Budget**: Lv1-5/Esper 1-2 (50-150 PP, basic telepathy/weak TK, single ability, minor strain), Lv6-10/Esper 3 (200-400 PP, combat-viable, 2-3 abilities, moderate strain), Lv11-15/Esper 4 (400-800 PP, master primary, 4-5 abilities/one perfect, high strain), Lv16-20/Esper 5 (800-1500 PP, reality warp, multi-mastery, catastrophic power), Lv21+/Esper 6 (1500+ PP, unrestricted warp, see power_tier_reference.md)

**Combat**: Psychic Attacks: Basic Lv3 (2d6-3d8, 20-40 PP), Advanced Lv4 (4d8-6d10, 60-100 PP), Master Lv5 (8d10-12d12/special, 120-200 PP), Ultimate (narrative, 300+ PP) | Mental Saves: WIS or INT higher | DC = 10 + INT mod + Esper Level

## Customization (Session 0)
**Strain Severity**: Low (minor)/Med/High (dangerous) | **Esper Rarity**: Common (10%)/Rare (1%)/Unique (protagonist) | **Power Compatibility**: Psychic+Magic (compatible)/Incompatible (brain damage) | **Emotion Influence**: High (Mob)/Med/Low (pure focus) | **Geass**: Common (Code Bearers everywhere)/Rare (single)/None | **Reality Warp**: Accessible (high-level)/Forbidden (Lv6 impossible)/Nonexistent | **Confirm Session 0, record world_state_schema**

## Errors
**Pitfalls**: ❌ Unlimited mind control (require saves, limit duration), Perfect precog (vague/limited), No strain (overuse=headache/brain damage/unconscious), Ignoring LOS (most require), Teleport spam (enforce PP/CD/strain) | **Validate**: 1. PP? 2. Strain threshold? 3. LOS required? 4. Distracted/injured/stressed? 5. Target save (WIS/INT)?
