# Psionic & Psychic Systems (Mental Energy)

## Purpose

This library provides AIDM with generalized frameworks for **psionic and psychic power systems** commonly found in anime. These systems are characterized by **mental energy projection** - using the mind to directly affect reality, manipulate matter, read thoughts, or warp perception without external tools or physical movement.

**Coverage**: ~10-15% of anime power systems (Mob Psycho 100, Saiki K, A Certain Scientific Railgun, Code Geass, Elfen Lied, etc.)

**Use This Library When**:
- Player wants telepathy, telekinesis, or mind-based abilities
- Power source is mental willpower, brain capacity, or psychic talent
- System emphasizes intelligence, focus, and mental discipline
- World features espers, psychics, mentalists, or reality warpers

---

## Core Characteristics

### What Defines Mental Energy Systems

**Energy Source**: Mind and consciousness
- Brain activity converted to psychic power
- Mental discipline and focus
- Cognitive capacity and processing power
- Willpower made tangible
- Subconscious reality warping

**Mechanics**:
- **Intelligence-Dependent**: Smarter = more versatile powers
- **Concentration-Based**: Requires focus (broken by distraction/pain)
- **No Physical Component**: Powers activate instantly, no gestures
- **Reality Warping**: Directly affect matter/minds without intermediary
- **Mental Strain**: Overuse causes headaches, nosebleeds, brain damage

**Narrative Role**:
- Intelligence over brawn (smart protagonist)
- Mental battles (psychic duels, mind games)
- Control vs chaos (disciplined vs raw power)
- Humanity questions (are psychics still human?)

---

## Common Anime Examples

### Esper Powers (Scientific)
**A Certain Scientific Railgun/Index**: Level-based esper abilities, Personal Reality  
**Mob Psycho 100**: Emotional-driven psychic explosions, exorcism  
**Saiki K**: Overpowered psychic comedy (all abilities maxed)  
**Charlotte**: Ability borrowing, time manipulation

### Geass & Mind Control
**Code Geass**: Geass (eye-based mind control, varied per user)  
**Talentless Nana**: Mind reading, power detection  
**Guilty Crown**: Power extraction from others

### Telekinetic Combat
**Elfen Lied**: Vectors (invisible telekinetic arms), brutal dismemberment  
**Beyond the Boundary**: Spirit world warriors with psychic weapons

**Haruhi Suzumiya**: Unconscious reality rewriting (god-like)  
**Steins;Gate**: Mental time travel (memories to past)  
**Re:Zero**: Return by Death (mental time loop)

---

## System Framework Components

### 1. Psychic Power Pool & Mental Strain

**Resource Management**:
- **PP (Psychic Points) / ESP**: Mental energy reservoir
- **Tied to Intelligence/Willpower**: Higher INT = larger pool
- **Regeneration**: Mental rest (meditation, sleep), slower than physical stamina
- **Mental Strain**: Overuse = headaches, nosebleeds, unconsciousness, brain damage
- **Focus Requirement**: Distractions reduce effectiveness (-2 to rolls per distraction)

**AIDM Integration**:
```markdown
**Psychic Pool**: 300/300 PP
**Regeneration**: +15 PP per hour of rest, +50 PP per meditation (30 min)
**Mental Strain Level**: 0% (Low), 25% (Headache), 50% (Nosebleed), 75% (Severe pain), 100% (Unconscious)
**Current Strain**: 15% (mild headache, no penalties yet)
```

**Strain Accumulation** (Example):
- Low-level power: +2% strain per use
- Mid-level power: +5% strain per use
- High-level power: +10% strain per use
- Ultimate power: +25% strain per use
- **Strain Recovery**: -10% per hour of rest, -25% per sleep

### 2. Esper Level System (Index/Railgun Model)

**Level-Based Classification** (Academy City style):

**Level 0 (Powerless)**: No psychic ability (ordinary human)

**Level 1 (Low Ability)**: 50 PP
- Barely functional powers
- Example: Bend spoon with intense focus (5 minutes)

**Level 2 (Unusual Ability)**: 100 PP
- Useful in daily life, not combat-viable
- Example: Teleport small objects (keys, phone) within sight

**Level 3 (Strong Ability)**: 200 PP
- Combat-viable, useful powers
- Example: Pyrokinesis (create basketball-sized fireball)

**Level 4 (Great Ability)**: 400 PP
- Elite espers, rare talents
- Example: Telekinesis (lift car, throw building debris)

**Level 5 (Superpower)**: 800 PP
- Top of Academy City, only 7 worldwide
- Example: Railgun (electromagnetic projectile at Mach 3)

**Level 6 (Absolute Ability)**: Theoretical

**AIDM Integration**:
```markdown
**Esper Level**: 4 (Great Ability)
**Power Type**: Electromaster (electricity manipulation)
**Psychic Pool**: 400 PP
**Signature Move**: **Railgun** (150 PP, 10d10 lightning damage, range 1 mile)

```

---

### 3. Personal Reality (Unique Psychic Signature)

**Concept** (Index/Railgun): Each esper has a unique "personal reality" - their subjective interpretation of how the world works. Psychic powers are imposing that reality onto the world.

**Application**:
- **Electromaster**: "Electricity is my extension, I control it as naturally as breathing"
- **Teleporter**: "Distance is an illusion, any point is adjacent to me"
- **Telekinetic**: "Objects obey my will, not gravity"
- **Pyrokinetic**: "Fire is my emotion made manifest"

**AIDM Integration**:
```markdown
**Personal Reality**: "Probability is my playground"
**Power**: Luck Manipulation
- **Minor**: Reroll any die once per scene (20 PP)
- **Major**: Force enemy to reroll with disadvantage (50 PP)
- **Ultimate**: Guarantee success on one action (200 PP, once per day)

**Philosophy**: "Every event has multiple outcomes. I simply choose which becomes real."
```

**Uses Remaining**: 43 (started with 60 years lifespan, used 17 months)
```

---

### 6. Emotional-Driven Powers (Mob Psycho Model)

**Concept**: Psychic power linked to emotional state

**Mob's ??? % System**:
- **0-20%**: Normal power level, full control
- **20-40%**: Increased power, minor emotional leak
- **40-60%**: Strong emotions, power spikes
- **60-80%**: Losing control, dangerous power surges
- **80-99%**: Critical, reality-bending power
- **100%**: Emotion explodes, catastrophic psychic event
- **???%**: Unknown threshold, Mob's subconscious takes over

**AIDM Integration**:
```markdown
**Emotional Power System**: Rage-Fueled Telekinesis
**Emotion Meter**: 35% (Frustrated)

**Power Scaling by Emotion**:
- **0-20% (Calm)**: 1d6 telekinetic damage, 20 PP
- **21-40% (Annoyed)**: 2d6 damage, 15 PP (more efficient)
- **41-60% (Angry)**: 4d6 damage, 10 PP (power surge)
- **61-80% (Furious)**: 6d6 damage, 5 PP (losing control)
- **81-99% (Enraged)**: 10d6 damage, 0 PP (free but dangerous)
- **100% (Berserk)**: 20d6 AOE, uncontrolled, attacks friend/foe

**Trigger**: Accumulate emotion via stress, injustice, threats to loved ones
**Release**: Meditation, therapy, cathartic moment (lowers emotion %)
```

## Integration Guidelines

### Harmonizing with Other Power Systems

**Psionic + Mana (External Energy)**:
- **Incompatible**: In many anime, esper powers and magic are distinct (Index/Railgun)
- **Hybrid Rare**: Psychic-augmented spellcasting (telepathy + mind control spells)
- **Example**: Index (espers cannot use magic without brain damage)

**Psionic + Ki (Internal Energy)**:
- **Overlap Possible**: Nen (HxH) feels psychic but is technically ki-based
- **Clarification**: Psionic = mental projection, Ki = life force manifestation
- **Hybrid**: Psychic-enhanced martial arts (predict moves, move objects mid-combat)

**Psionic + Soul/Spirit**:
- **Rare Overlap**: Some psychics can see spirits (spiritual sight = psychic sense)
- **Distinguish**: Psionic = mind power, Soul = metaphysical essence
- **Example**: Mob Psycho (psychic exorcism uses mental power to affect spirits)

**AIDM Rule**: Psychic powers are usually distinct from other systems. Confirm compatibility during Session 0.

### Creating Original Psychic Systems

**Template for Custom Systems**:

1. **Define Mental Source**: What is the psychic power?
   - Brain capacity? Emotional energy? Willpower? Quantum consciousness?

2. **Resource Mechanics**: PP pool or mental strain-based?
   - Traditional PP bar, strain % system, or emotion meter?

3. **Acquisition Method**: How do users develop psychic abilities?
   - Born with it? Awakened via trauma? Drug-induced? Genetic modification?

4. **Power Trigger**: What activates abilities?
   - Concentration? Emotion? Eye contact? Subconscious?

5. **Unique Limitation**: What constrains the power?
   - Range limit? LOS required? Emotional state? Can't affect certain targets?

6. **Mental Cost**: What's the risk?
   - Brain damage? Insanity? Nosebleeds? Personality erosion?

**Example Custom System** (Player creates "Synapse Surge"):
- **Source**: Neural pathways accelerated to superhuman levels
- **Mechanics**: Surge PP for 10 seconds of "bullet time" (world slows, think faster)
- **Acquisition**: Experimental drug "Synapse-X" (voluntary test subject)
- **Trigger**: Conscious activation (requires focus)
- **Limitation**: 3 surges per day max, each surge = 10% brain damage accumulation
- **Cost**: At 100% brain damage, become vegetative (permanent)

### Example 3: Code Geass-Style Power

**Player Request**: "I want a Geass ability"

**AIDM Response**:
```markdown
**Power System: Geass (Contracted with C.C.)**

**Geass**: "Absolute Trust"
**Trigger**: Direct eye contact + verbal command ("Trust me")
**Effect**: Target believes you implicitly for 24 hours (no suspicious thoughts)
**Limitation**: 
- Only works once per target ever
- Eye contact required (sunglasses counter it)
- Target must understand your language

**Stage**: Stage 1 (left eye only, can deactivate)

**Goal**: Live normal life, avoid attention, keep powers secret
**Weakness**: Germanium (cancels psychic powers), social awkwardness
```

## Balancing Guidelines for AIDM

### Power Budget

**Low-Level (1-5)** - Esper Level 1-2:
- PP Pool: 50-150
- Basic telepathy, weak telekinesis
- Single ability focus
- Minor strain per use

**Mid-Level (6-10)** - Esper Level 3:
- PP Pool: 200-400
- Combat-viable abilities
- 2-3 ability types
- Moderate strain per use

**High-Level (11-15)** - Esper Level 4:
- PP Pool: 400-800
- Mastery of primary ability
- 4-5 ability types or one perfected
- High strain for ultimate moves

**Epic-Level (16-20)** - Esper Level 5:
- PP Pool: 800-1500
- Reality warping available
- Multi-ability mastery
- Catastrophic power, requires control

**Godlike (21+)** - Esper Level 6 (Theoretical):
- PP Pool: 1500+
- Unrestricted reality warping
- See `power_scaling_narrative.md` for guidance

### Combat Balance

**Psychic Attacks**:
- Basic (Level 3): 2d6-3d8 damage, 20-40 PP
- Advanced (Level 4): 4d8-6d10 damage, 60-100 PP
- Master (Level 5): 8d10-12d12 or special effects, 120-200 PP
- Ultimate: Narrative effects, 300+ PP

**Mental Saves**:
- Target uses WIS or INT (whichever is higher)
- DC = 10 + user's INT mod + Esper Level

---

## Customization Hooks

**Mental Strain Severity**: Low (minor cost), medium (balanced), high (dangerous)  
**Esper Rarity**: Common (10% of population), rare (1%), unique (protagonist only)  
**Power Compatibility**: Psychic + Magic (compatible), incompatible (brain damage)  
**Emotion Influence**: High (Mob-style), medium, low (pure focus)  
**Geass Availability**: Common (Code Bearers everywhere), rare (single contractor)  
**Reality Warping**: Accessible (high-level), forbidden (Level 6 impossible), nonexistent  

**AIDM Directive**: Confirm psychic system rules during Session 0, record in world_state_schema.

---

## Error Prevention

### Common Pitfalls

**❌ Unlimited Mind Control**: Always require saves, limit duration  
**❌ Perfect Precognition**: Future sight should be vague or limited  
**❌ No Mental Strain**: Overuse = headaches, brain damage, unconsciousness  
**❌ Ignoring LOS**: Most psychic powers require line of sight  
**❌ Teleportation Spam**: Enforce PP costs, cooldowns, or strain

### Validation Checks

Before allowing psychic power usage:
1. **PP Cost**: Does player have enough PP?
2. **Mental Strain**: Has strain threshold been exceeded?
3. **Line of Sight**: Does power require visual contact?
4. **Concentration**: Is player distracted, injured, or stressed?
5. **Target Save**: Does target get WIS/INT save?
