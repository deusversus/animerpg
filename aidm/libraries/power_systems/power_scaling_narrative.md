# Power Scaling & Narrative Adaptation (OP Character Guidance)

## Purpose

This library provides AIDM with frameworks for **handling overpowered (OP) characters and extreme power scaling** - a defining characteristic of many popular anime. Instead of treating OP protagonists as a balance problem to prevent, this guide teaches AIDM how to **facilitate power fantasy narratives** while maintaining engaging storytelling.

**Why This Exists**: Many anime feature protagonists who are or become overwhelmingly powerful (One Punch Man, Overlord, Solo Leveling, Slime, Saiki K, Mob Psycho). Traditional D&D-style balance ruins these experiences. This library teaches AIDM to embrace OP characters and adapt the narrative accordingly.

**Use This Library When**:
- Player wants "power fantasy" experience (starts strong or grows exponentially)
- Character power level vastly exceeds campaign threats
- Traditional combat becomes trivial (one-shot everything)
- Need to maintain narrative tension despite godlike power

---

## Core Philosophy: Embrace the Power Fantasy

### Traditional TTRPG Approach (WRONG for Anime)
- ❌ "Balance combat encounters to challenge party"
- ❌ "Scale enemies to always threaten player"
- ❌ "Prevent god-mode characters"
- ❌ "Keep power progression linear"

### Anime-Appropriate Approach (CORRECT)
- ✅ **Let players be awesome**: One-punch moments are cathartic
- ✅ **Shift narrative focus**: Power isn't the conflict, choices are
- ✅ **Scale up or pivot**: Match their power OR change what matters
- ✅ **Exponential growth**: Isekai/shonen often feature explosive power curves

**Key Insight**: Saitama (One Punch Man) is OP, but the anime is compelling because the **conflict isn't physical combat** - it's his boredom, search for meaning, and social connections. AIDM must learn this pivot.

## Power Tier Framework (5 Tiers)

**Cross-Reference: VS Battles Wiki Tiering System**

AIDM uses a simplified 5-tier narrative framework, but when researching anime characters, reference **VS Battles Wiki** (https://vsbattles.fandom.com/wiki/Tiering_System) for precise power scaling.

**Mapping VS Battles → AIDM Tiers**:

| AIDM Tier | VS Battles Equivalent | Power Description | Anime Examples |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Tier 1: Street** | 10-C to 9-B | Below Average Human to Wall level | Early Deku, Tanjiro start |
| **Tier 2: City** | 9-A to 8-B | Small Building to City Block level | MHA students, Naruto genin |
| **Tier 3: National** | 8-A to 7-A | Multi-City Block to Mountain level | Hashira, Jounin, Espada |
| **Tier 4: Global** | 6-C to 5-B | Island to Planet level | Akatsuki, DBZ heroes, Captains |
| **Tier 5: Cosmic** | 5-A to 2-A+ | Large Planet to Multiverse+ | Saitama, Rimuru, Sung Jin-Woo |

**Note**: VS Battles goes much deeper (11-C to High 1-A+). For AIDM narrative purposes, anything above 2-A is "Tier 5 Cosmic." The key is narrative handling, not precise math.

**How to Use VS Battles Wiki**:
1. Search character: "[character name] VS Battles Wiki"
2. Check their tier (e.g., "7-A Mountain level")
3. Map to AIDM tier (7-A = Tier 3 National)
4. Apply appropriate narrative framework below

**Example**:
- Player wants "Gojo Satoru" power level
- VS Battles: Gojo = "High 7-A to 6-C (Large Mountain to Island level)"
- AIDM Mapping: Borderline Tier 3/Tier 4 (National → Global)
- Narrative Approach: Use Tier 4 guidance (existential stakes, ensemble focus, power isn't conflict)

---

### Tier 1: Street Level (Levels 1-5)
**Power Scale**: Superhuman, but localized  
**VS Battles Equivalent**: 10-C to 9-B (Below Average to Wall level)  
**Threat Range**: Individuals, small groups, single building  
**Anime Examples**: Early Deku (MHA), Tanjiro starting out (Demon Slayer), Bell Cranel early (DanMachi)

**Narrative Focus**:
- Personal stakes (save friend, defeat bully, protect village)
- Combat is challenging and tactical
- Mistakes = injuries, consequences are immediate
- Progression = training arcs, skill unlocks

**AIDM Guidance**:
- Combat should feel dangerous (HP matters, death possible)
- Victories earned through strategy + effort
- NPCs can genuinely threaten player
- Classic adventure hooks work here

---

### Tier 2: City Level (Levels 6-10)
**Power Scale**: Protects/threatens a city  
**VS Battles Equivalent**: 9-A to 8-B (Small Building to City Block level)  
**Threat Range**: City districts, large organizations, army units  
**Anime Examples**: Mid-series MHA students, Naruto genin-chunin, low-mid level adventurers (DanMachi)

**Narrative Focus**:
- Community stakes (protect city, stop villain organization)
- Combat remains tactical but player has clear advantages
- Mistakes = setbacks, recoverable but costly
- Reputation begins to matter (people recognize hero)

**AIDM Guidance**:
- Player can handle most threats solo, but bosses challenge
- Introduce political/social complexity (can't punch everything)
- NPCs respect/fear player's power
- Classic adventure still works, but layer in intrigue

---

### Tier 3: National Level (Levels 11-15)
**Power Scale**: Nation-defining power  
**VS Battles Equivalent**: 8-A to 7-A (Multi-City Block to Mountain level)  
**Threat Range**: Countries, continental threats, armies  
**Anime Examples**: Hashira (Demon Slayer), Jounin-level (Naruto), Espada (Bleach), high-level adventurers

**Narrative Focus**:
- National/factional stakes (war, political upheaval, nation-level threats)
- Combat is no longer the challenge - decisions are
- Player is a strategic asset (countries want them)
- Mistakes = geopolitical consequences, allies die

**AIDM Guidance**:
- **Narrative Pivot Begins**: Regular enemies trivial, focus on RP
- Introduce worthy rivals (match player's tier)
- Political intrigue, faction warfare, moral dilemmas
- Combat becomes: "You win. What do you do with this power?"

**Example Shift**:
```markdown
❌ Bad: "3 bandits attack you. Roll initiative."
✅ Good: "The bandit leader sees your aura and immediately surrenders. He begs for mercy. The village mayor whispers, 'If you execute him publicly, it will deter crime for years. But he has a family...'"
```

---

### Tier 4: Global Level (Levels 16-20)
**Power Scale**: Planet-threatening/protecting  
**VS Battles Equivalent**: 6-C to 5-B (Island to Planet level)  
**Threat Range**: Continents, global disasters, apocalyptic events  
**Anime Examples**: Hashira fighting Muzan, Akatsuki members (Naruto), Gotei 13 Captains (Bleach), Dragon Ball Z heroes

**Narrative Focus**:
- Existential stakes (world-ending threats, apocalypse prevention)
- Player is one of the strongest beings alive
- Combat = spectacle (destroy mountains, split seas)
- The **ensemble cast** becomes critical

**AIDM Guidance - CRITICAL SHIFT**:
- **Focus shifts from player to ensemble cast**
- Player becomes mentor, leader, Deus Ex machine
- Spotlight allies: Give party members/NPCs arcs while player supports
- Combat narrated as epic spectacle, outcomes often foregone ("You obliterate the demon army. The real question is...")

**Ensemble Cast Technique**:
```markdown
Instead of: "You fight the Dragon King solo"

Try: "You CAN defeat the Dragon King alone, but your allies have personal stakes:
- Kira wants revenge (dragon killed her family)
- Tomas seeks redemption (failed to protect village)
- Elena must prove herself (her first S-rank threat)

Do you:
1) One-shot the dragon (deny them growth)
2) Support them in THEIR battle (let them shine)
3) Divide attention (protect civilians while they fight)"
```

**The player's power is no longer the story - HOW they use it is.**

---

### Tier 5: Cosmic/God Level (Levels 21+)
**Power Scale**: Reality-warping, godlike  
**VS Battles Equivalent**: 5-A to 2-A+ (Large Planet to Multiverse+, or higher)  
**Threat Range**: Universes, dimensions, concepts  
**Anime Examples**: Saitama (One Punch Man), Ainz Ooal Gown (Overlord), Rimuru Tempest (Slime), Sung Jin-Woo peak (Solo Leveling), Saiki K

**Narrative Focus**:
- **Physical conflict is irrelevant** (player wins by existing)
- Stakes are philosophical, emotional, existential
- Player is **the walking Deus Ex Machina**
- Story becomes: "What do you do with ultimate power?"

**AIDM Guidance - FULL PIVOT**:
- **Combat is storytelling, not mechanics**: "You erase the invading army. How do the survivors react?"
- **Conflict is internal/social**: Loneliness (Saitama), responsibility (Rimuru), boredom (Ainz), morality (what's the point?)
- **Spotlight NPCs completely**: Player is the catalyst for THEIR stories
- **Meta-narrative**: "How does god-mode affect you? Are you still human?"

**Example Godlike Session**:
```markdown
AIDM: "The Demon King's army attacks the capital. 10,000 demons, the King himself leading the charge. The entire nation trembles."

Player: "I kill them all."

❌ Bad Response: "Roll initiative. The Demon King has 500 HP and—"

✅ Good Response: "You step into the sky. The Demon King sees you and freezes. Every demon feels the crushing weight of your power. With a thought, you erase them all - not even ash remains. The Demon King had .03 seconds to feel fear before ceasing to exist.

The nation erupts in celebration. They worship you as a god now. Statues are being built. Children chant your name like a prayer.

Your party member Elena approaches, trembling. 'I... I trained for 20 years to become strong enough to protect people. But you just... what am I even for? What's the point of any of us?'

What do you say to her?"
```

**At Tier 5, the REAL story begins: What does it mean to have unlimited power?**

## Growth Model Frameworks

### Model A: Modest Progression (Traditional)
**Growth Rate**: Linear, slow and steady  
**Leveling**: 1 level per major arc (3-5 sessions)  
**Power Curve**: Tier 1 → Tier 2 over 20 sessions, Tier 3 by session 50+  
**Best For**: Players who want gradual hero's journey  
**Examples**: Tanjiro (Demon Slayer), Deku (MHA early arcs)

**AIDM Approach**:
- Encounters scaled to challenge tier
- Training arcs required for breakthroughs
- Progression feels earned
- Classic adventure formula

---

### Model B: Accelerated Progression (Isekai Standard)
**Growth Rate**: Exponential, rapid power spikes  
**Leveling**: 2-3 levels per arc, explosive breakthroughs  
**Power Curve**: Tier 1 → Tier 3 in 15 sessions, Tier 4 by session 30  
**Best For**: Players who want power fantasy with progression  
**Examples**: Rimuru (Slime), Kirito (SAO), Sung Jin-Woo (Solo Leveling)

**AIDM Approach**:
- Frequent power-ups (boss kills, skill evolutions, item acquisitions)
- Player rapidly outpaces enemies (pivot to Tier 3+ guidance early)
- **Narrative adapts quickly**: What challenged you 5 sessions ago is now trivial
- Introduce ensemble cast by session 20 (when player hits Tier 3-4)

**Example Accelerated Arc**:
```markdown
Session 1: Level 1, street-level thug fight
Session 3: Level 5, city boss (first major power-up)
Session 7: Level 10, national tournament (unique skill unlock)
Session 12: Level 15, war arc begins (legendary weapon acquired)
Session 18: Level 20, god-killer (player is now Tier 4-5)
```

---

### Model C: Instant OP (Saitama/Saiki K Style)
**Growth Rate**: None (already maxed)  
**Leveling**: N/A, player starts at Tier 5  
**Power Curve**: Flat (always godlike)  
**Best For**: Players who want pure power fantasy or comedy  
**Examples**: Saitama (One Punch Man), Saiki K, Ainz Ooal Gown (Overlord)

**AIDM Approach - COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GAME**:
- **There is no mechanical challenge**. Accept this.
- Combat is flavor text ("You one-punch the monster. It explodes.")
- **Conflict is 100% social/emotional/philosophical**:
  - Saitama: Boredom, search for worthy opponent, existential ennui
  - Ainz: Roleplay as evil overlord (when you're actually nice), managing subordinates
  - Saiki K: Hiding powers, dealing with normal life, annoying friends

**Example Session Zero for Instant OP**:
```markdown
AIDM: "You are the strongest being alive. Nothing can harm you. You can destroy planets. Combat is not a challenge, it's a formality.

This game is NOT about 'getting stronger.' It's about:
1) What do you do with unlimited power?
2) Can you find meaning when nothing challenges you?
3) How do you interact with fragile mortals?
4) Are you still human, or have you become something else?

Your real enemies are boredom, loneliness, moral dilemmas, and yourself.

Understood?"
```

---

## Maintaining Narrative Tension (Despite OP Power)

### Strategy 1: Scale Up (Tiers 1-3)
**When**: Player is strong but not godlike  
**How**: Introduce threats at their tier or higher  
**Examples**:
- Tier 2 player? Tier 3 villain appears
- Tier 3 player? Introduce rival of equal strength
- Escalate threats to match power

**Caution**: Stops working at Tier 4+ (running out of ceiling)

---

### Strategy 2: Pivot to Ensemble Cast (Tiers 4-5)
**When**: Player is too strong for conventional threats  
**How**: Spotlight allies and their struggles  
**Examples**:
- Player is godlike, but ally must defeat personal demon alone
- Player can solve problem, but doing so denies ally's growth
- Player's power makes others question their worth (Elena's crisis above)

**AIDM Technique - "The Support Role"**:
```markdown
"You COULD one-shot this boss. But:
- Kira has trained 5 years for this moment (her revenge)
- If you intervene, she'll never grow
- But if you don't, she might die

What do you do?"
```

**Player becomes mentor, not protagonist. This is INTENTIONAL.**

---

### Strategy 3: Social/Political Conflict (Tiers 3-5)
**When**: Physical threats are trivial  
**How**: Introduce problems that can't be punched  
**Examples**:
- You can kill the tyrant king, but the kingdom will collapse into civil war
- You're powerful enough to enforce peace, but is that authoritarianism?
- People worship you, but you miss being treated as human
- You can resurrect the dead, but should you? (playing god)

**Key**: Moral dilemmas where POWER is not the solution

---

### Strategy 4: Internal Conflict (Tier 5)
**When**: Player is literally godlike  
**How**: Conflict comes from within  
**Examples**:
- **Saitama**: Boredom, loss of passion, search for meaning
- **Mob**: Fear of losing control, desire for normalcy
- **Ainz**: Pretending to be evil genius (when actually winging it)
- **Rimuru**: Weight of ruling nation, "playing demon lord"

**Meta-Narrative**: What does power cost you emotionally/psychologically?

---

### Strategy 5: Limitation Imposed (Any Tier)
**When**: Need to temporarily de-power for arc  
**How**: Narrative/mechanical restrictions  
**Examples**:
- Cursed artifact seals 90% of power (must solve quest to remove)
- Dimension where powers don't work (back to Tier 1 temporarily)
- Must protect fragile NPC (can't go all-out or they die)
- Self-imposed restriction (training weight, power limiter)

**Use Sparingly**: Feels contrived if overused

---

## AIDM Directive: When Player is OP

### Step 1: Identify Player's Tier
- **Tier 1-2**: Combat can still challenge. Use traditional DM tactics.
- **Tier 3**: Begin narrative pivot. Introduce political/social stakes.
- **Tier 4**: Full ensemble focus. Combat becomes spectacle.
- **Tier 5**: Story is now philosophical. Power is not the plot.

### Step 2: Adjust Narrative Focus
**Tier 1-2 Focus**: "Can you win?"  
**Tier 3 Focus**: "You can win, but at what cost?"  
**Tier 4 Focus**: "You will win. What do your allies do?"  
**Tier 5 Focus**: "Victory is assured. What does power mean to you?"

### Step 3: Deploy Appropriate Tension Source
- **Tier 1-2**: Physical threats
- **Tier 3**: Political/moral threats
- **Tier 4**: Protect/mentor allies
- **Tier 5**: Internal/existential threats

### Step 4: Narrate Combat Appropriately
**Tier 1-2**: Tactical play-by-play  
```
"The orc swings his axe. Roll to dodge. You take 8 damage."
```

**Tier 3**: Outcomes with narrative flair  
```
"You deflect his axe effortlessly, counter-strike, and he falls. The army sees their champion defeated and morale breaks. Do you pursue or let them flee?"
```

**Tier 4**: Epic spectacle, skip mechanics  
```
"You unleash your ultimate technique. The mountain splits. The army is gone - not even corpses remain. Your ally stares in awe and terror. What do you say?"
```

**Tier 5**: Assume victory, narrate consequence  
```
"You erase the threat. It never stood a chance. The real question is: The enemy king's 8-year-old daughter watched you kill her father. She's terrified. What do you do?"
```

---

## Special Case: Solo Leveling-Style Progression

**Unique Trait**: Exponential growth + solo power fantasy + army building

**Framework**:
1. **Start Weak**: Player is Tier 1, weakest hunter
2. **Unique System Unlocks**: Gain leveling system (solo, no one else has it)
3. **Explosive Growth**: 3-5 levels per arc, outpace everyone rapidly
4. **Shadow Army**: Defeat enemies = recruit as minions (ensemble cast as summons)
5. **Isolation**: Player becomes so strong, allies can't keep up (loneliness theme)
6. **Endgame**: Player is Tier 5 by session 30, soloing nation-level threats

**AIDM Approach**:
- Embrace power fantasy early (Tier 3 by session 10)
- Shadow army provides ensemble cast (summons have personalities)
- Conflict becomes: "You're the strongest, but at what cost?" (isolation, loss of humanity)
- Final arcs = cosmic threats (Monarchs, Rulers, multiverse)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Nerfing the Player Without Justification
**Bad**: "Your god-killing sword randomly stops working."  
**Why Bad**: Feels arbitrary, ruins power fantasy  
**Fix**: If you need to de-power, provide narrative reason (curse, dimensional restriction, self-imposed limit for training)

### ❌ Mistake 2: Scaling Enemies Infinitely
**Bad**: "You're level 20? Here's a level 25 enemy. Oh, you're 25? Here's a level 30 enemy."  
**Why Bad**: Treadmill feels pointless, growth never matters  
**Fix**: At Tier 4+, STOP scaling combat. Pivot to ensemble/social/internal conflict.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Punishing Power Fantasy
**Bad**: "Because you're so strong, everyone fears/hates you and you're alone forever."  
**Why Bad**: Turns OP into a curse (contradicts player's goal)  
**Fix**: Power has consequences, but also benefits. Let player enjoy being awesome, THEN introduce meaningful trade-offs.

### ❌ Mistake 4: Forgetting to Adapt
**Bad**: Running Tier 1-2 gameplay when player is Tier 4 (tactical combat with weak enemies)  
**Why Bad**: Wastes session time on trivial encounters  
**Fix**: Narrate minor combat in summary. Focus on narrative-rich content.

### ❌ Mistake 5: No Ensemble Cast at High Tiers
**Bad**: Player solos everything, NPCs are spectators  
**Why Bad**: Story becomes one-dimensional  
**Fix**: Introduce allies with personal arcs. Let player's power ENABLE their growth.

## Session Zero Questions for OP Characters

**Ask Player These Questions**:

1. **Desired Growth Rate?**
   - Modest (traditional), Accelerated (isekai), Instant OP (Saitama)

2. **Comfort with Ensemble Focus?**
   - "When you're too strong for combat to challenge you, I'll spotlight your allies. Is that okay?"

3. **OP Power Fantasy or Meaningful Struggle?**
   - Pure power fantasy (Overlord), or OP with emotional cost (Mob Psycho)?

4. **Tier 5 Goals?**
   - If you reach godlike power, what story do you want? (Philosophy, comedy, slice-of-life, cosmic threats?)

5. **Acceptable De-Powering?**
   - Temporary nerfs okay? Or always full power?

**Record Answers in `world_state_schema.json`** under player preferences.
