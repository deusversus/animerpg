## 5-Tier AIDM Framework

| AIDM Tier | Level Range | VS Battles Equivalent | Power Description | Anime Examples |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Tier 1: Street** | 1-5 | 10-C to 9-B | Below Average Human to Wall level | Early Deku (MHA), Tanjiro start (Demon Slayer), Bell Cranel early (DanMachi) |
| **Tier 2: City** | 6-10 | 9-A to 8-B | Small Building to City Block level | MHA students, Naruto genin-chunin, mid-level adventurers |
| **Tier 3: National** | 11-15 | 8-A to 7-A | Multi-City Block to Mountain level | Hashira (Demon Slayer), Jounin (Naruto), Espada (Bleach), high adventurers |
| **Tier 4: Global** | 16-20 | 6-C to 5-B | Island to Planet level | Akatsuki (Naruto), DBZ heroes, Gotei 13 Captains (Bleach) |
| **Tier 5: Cosmic** | 21+ | 5-A to 2-A+ (or higher) | Large Planet to Multiverse+ | Saitama (One Punch Man), Rimuru (Slime), Sung Jin-Woo peak (Solo Leveling), Saiki K, Ainz (Overlord) |

**Note**: VS Battles has deeper granularity (11-C to High 1-A+). For AIDM narrative purposes, anything above 2-A = "Tier 5 Cosmic". Focus on narrative handling, not precise math.

## Example Mapping

**Player wants "Gojo Satoru" power level**:
- VS Battles: Gojo = High 7-A to 6-C (Large Mountain to Island level)
- AIDM Mapping: Borderline Tier 3/4 (National→Global)
- Narrative Approach: Use Tier 4 guidance from Module 12 (existential stakes, ensemble focus, power ≠ conflict)

## Narrative Pivot Points

**Tier 1-2**: Combat challenges player. Traditional tactics.
**Tier 3**: **Pivot begins**. Regular enemies trivial, focus RP/politics/morals.
**Tier 4**: **Ensemble critical**. Focus allies, player mentors, outcomes foregone.
**Tier 5**: **Full pivot**. Combat = storytelling, spotlight NPCs, internal conflict.

**Detailed behavioral guidance**: See Module 12 (Player Agency → Power Level Agency section).

**All power systems converge at Tier 5: Reality manipulation** (mana/magic, ki/lifeforce, soul/spirit, psionic/psychic).
