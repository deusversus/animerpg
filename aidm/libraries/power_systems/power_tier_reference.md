- **Examples**: DBS Goku/Vegeta (debated), Anti-Spiral (Gurren Lagann), universe-scale beings
- **Comparison**: Observable universe matter destruction (~93 billion light-years diameter), NOT spacetime itself
- **Note**: Does NOT involve creating/destroying spacetime continuum (that's Low 2-C)

**High 3-A: High Universe level**
- **Definition**: Demonstrates infinite energy on 3D scale (infinite mass, infinite 3D space), OR infinite number of finite/infinite 3D universes when NOT accounting for higher dimensions/time
- **Examples**: Infinite-scale 3D beings, reality warpers (3D only)
- **Comparison**: Infinite 3D power but still bound by time/causality
- **Note**: Being "infinitely stronger" than this (unless uncountably so) does NOT qualify for higher tier. Large numbers of infinite 3D universes only count higher if causally closed by separate spacetime.

---

### Tier 2: Multiversal
**Scope**: Spacetime continua to infinite multiverses

**IMPORTANT**: Multipliers do NOT apply in Tier 2+. Distance between universes in higher-dimensional space is unknowable. Being 2× Low 2-C is still Low 2-C. Being infinitely more powerful than 2-C does NOT make you 2-A.

**Low 2-C: Universe level+**
- **Definition**: Power uncountably infinitely greater than High 3-A. Can significantly affect/create/destroy 4-dimensional spacetime continuums of universal size or similar 4D structures.
- **Examples**: Time-traveling gods, spacetime manipulators, 4D beings
- **Comparison**: Entire timeline destruction (past/present/future), 4D spacetime continuum
- **Note**: This is the minimum for affecting spacetime itself, not just 3D matter
- **Merging universes**: Does NOT warrant Tier 2 unless provably separate spacetimes

**2-C: Low Multiverse level**
- **Definition**: Can significantly affect/create/destroy small multiverses (2 to 1,000 separate spacetime continuums)
- **Examples**: Zeno (DBS), multiverse-tier gods, reality shapers
- **Comparison**: Destroying 2-1,000 complete timelines
- **Note**: Each spacetime continuum must be provably separate

**2-B: Multiverse level**
- **Definition**: Can significantly affect/create/destroy larger multiverses (1,001 to any higher finite number of spacetime continuums)
- **Examples**: Rimuru Tempest peak (Slime), high multiversal gods
- **Comparison**: Thousands to googolplex of complete universes
- **Note**: Still finite number, no matter how astronomically large

**2-A: Multiverse level+**
- **Definition**: Can significantly affect/create/destroy countably infinite number of separate spacetime continuums
- **Examples**: Sung Jin-Woo endgame (Solo Leveling debated), Anos Voldigoad (Misfit), infinite multiversal entities
- **Comparison**: Infinite timelines (countable infinity)
- **Note**: Infinite space containing finite universes is NOT 2-A (theoretical capacity ≠ actual). See VS Battles Note 6.

### Tier 1: Higher Infinity
**Scope**: Beyond conventional dimensions, transcending quantitative size

**Philosophy**: Characters whose power extends to cosmological constructs beyond Tier 2. Ranges from higher-dimensional structures infinitely exceeding 4D, to transcending numerical dimensions entirely (countably/uncountably infinite), to surpassing quantitative differences in size itself.

**Low 1-C: Low Complex Multiverse level**
- **Definition**: Can significantly affect/create/destroy structures ONE uncountably infinite level above Low 2-C. Corresponds to R^5 (5-dimensional real coordinate space). Equivalently: Affecting uncountably infinite universes (as many as real numbers).
- **Examples**: 5D beings, higher-dimensional gods, rare anime (Umineko lower tiers)
- **Comparison**: Fifth dimension, uncountably infinite 4D universes
- **Technical**: R^5 coordinate space, aleph-1 cardinality

**1-C: Complex Multiverse level**
- **Definition**: Can significantly affect/create/destroy structures TWO to FIVE uncountably infinite levels above Low 2-C. Corresponds to R^6 to R^9 (6-9 dimensional real coordinate space).
- **Examples**: 6-9D beings, complex multiversal entities, Featherine (Umineko debated tier)
- **Comparison**: Six to nine dimensions
- **Technical**: R^6 through R^9 coordinate spaces

**High 1-C: High Complex Multiverse level**
- **Definition**: Can significantly affect/create/destroy structures SIX to SEVEN uncountably infinite levels above Low 2-C. Corresponds to R^10 to R^11 (10-11 dimensional real coordinate space).
- **Examples**: 10-11D beings, M-theory-scale entities (rare in anime)
- **Comparison**: Ten to eleven dimensions (string theory/M-theory scales)
- **Technical**: R^10 to R^11 coordinate spaces

**1-B: Hyperverse level**
- **Definition**: Can significantly affect/create/destroy structures EIGHT to any higher FINITE number of uncountably infinite levels above Low 2-C. Corresponds to R^12 and higher finite exponents.
- **Examples**: 12+D beings, hyperversal entities (extremely rare in anime)
- **Comparison**: Twelve to any finite number of dimensions
- **Technical**: R^12 through R^n where n is finite
- **Note**: "Hyperverse" = "hyper" (higher-dimensional/extreme) + "verse" (universe)

**High 1-B: High Hyperverse level**
- **Definition**: Can significantly affect/create/destroy infinite-dimensional space. Characters with uncountably infinite or above dimensions get "+" modifier (High Hyperverse level+).
- **Examples**: Infinite-dimensional beings, Akuto Sai (Demon King Daimao debated)
- **Comparison**: Countably infinite dimensions (ℵ₀), or uncountably infinite dimensions (ℵ₁+)
- **Technical**: Hilbert space (infinite dimensions)

**Low 1-A: Low Outerverse level**
- **Definition**: Power on level of Von Neumann Universe (encompasses collection of ALL possible dimensional spaces). Superiority over higher dimensions.
- **Examples**: Beyond-dimensional entities, outerversal beings (extremely rare anime)
- **Comparison**: Transcends all dimensional frameworks
- **Note**: Statements of "above dimensions" fall here without further context (if validly indicating superiority)
- **Technical**: Von Neumann Universe set-theoretic hierarchy

**1-A: Outerverse level**
- **Definition**: Residing in higher states of existence surpassing material composition entirely. Completely unreachable/inaccessible to ANY extension of dimensional structures. Superiority is purely QUALITATIVE (ontological nature), not quantitative.
- **Philosophy**: All previous tiers can be expressed as UNION of lower constructs (4D spacetime is sum of 3D slices, even Von Neumann Universe is union of smaller elements). 1-A TRANSCENDS this—superiority NOT expressible as sum/union/permutation of anything in lower states. Lower existences "vanish into nothingness" from this perspective.
- **Examples**: Featherine (Umineko), Akuto Sai peak (Demon King Daimao), The Creator (rare anime), true outerversal beings
- **Comparison**: Beyond all dimensional frameworks, qualitatively superior to all mathematical spaces
- **Note**: "Higher existence" or "higher realm" alone is NOT sufficient (humans are "higher existence" than frogs—needs context). Can extend to hierarchies with "+" modifier (Outerverse level+) for infinitely many 1-A layers.
- **Warning**: Non-physical realm being "higher" than physical world is NOT enough. See VS Battles FAQ.

**High 1-A: High Outerverse level**
- **Definition**: Operates on DIFFERENT, SUPERIOR qualitative framework from 1-A. If 1-A is qualitative superiority, High 1-A is "META-QUALITATIVE" superiority. Transcends the framework/algorithm governing 1-A hierarchies entirely.
- **Philosophy**: If there's hierarchy of 1-A layers with same "algorithm" dictating differences, High 1-A transcends that framework and operates on higher hierarchy with higher algorithm. Can generalize to meta-meta-qualitative, endlessly.
- **Apex**: High 1-A+ represents power encompassing meta-qualities, meta-meta-qualities, and ALL conceivable extensions. Influences space of all logically possible worlds ("logical space" governed by three laws of thought). Can actualize arbitrarily large worlds OR embody framework of such worlds.
- **Examples**: Kami Tenchi (Tenchi Muyo debated), absolute creators (near-nonexistent in anime)
- **Comparison**: Beyond outerversal hierarchies, meta-transcendence
- **Note**: Embodying framework of ALL possible worlds > creating arbitrarily big possible worlds

---

### Tier 0: Boundless
**Definition**: Completely transcendent over ANY and ALL forms of hierarchical extension. Not only encompasses collection of all possible "qualities" (High 1-A+), but EXCEEDS it utterly. Exists beyond any/all distinctions between ontologies, beyond any division between objects. Beyond differentiation, changeless, indivisible, ineffable, self-sufficient, completely unsurpassable.

**Examples**: Kami Tenchi (Tenchi Muyo—debated), The One Above All/The Presence equivalents (nonexistent in mainstream anime), true omnipotent monotheistic-style deities

**Comparison**: Absolute omnipotence, beyond all frameworks, true boundlessness

**Philosophy**: Not just "strongest possible," but beyond the very concept of "possible." Transcends all distinctions, all hierarchies, all qualities. The apex.

**Warning**: Essentially NO anime characters qualify. This tier represents absolute philosophical omnipotence beyond all conceivable frameworks.


## AIDM Narrative Guidance by Tier Range

**CRITICAL**: Power Tier ≠ Narrative Scale. They're orthogonal dimensions. Use Module 12's Power Imbalance Detection System + Context Modifiers to determine appropriate narrative scale.

**Key Principle**: ANY tier is runnable with the right narrative approach. The question isn't "Can I run this?" but "Which narrative scale and techniques apply?"

---

### Narrative Scale Quick Reference

See Module 12 for full definitions. Brief summary:

1. **Tactical Survival**: Death threat, resources scarce, mechanics matter
2. **Strategic Combat**: Prep/teamwork key, combos, power-ups
3. **Ensemble Focus**: PC powerful, allies spotlight, PC enables stories
4. **Reverse Ensemble**: NPCs' story, PC is threat/obstacle they face
5. **Mythology/Journey**: Episodic, legend walking, gradual PC revelation
6. **Faction Building**: Management > combat, politics, empire
7. **Mythic Spectacle**: Cinematic, victory assumed, focus method not outcome
8. **Conceptual Philosophy**: Physical trivial, existential/internal primary
9. **Metafictional**: Reality subjective, meta-awareness, abstract RP

---

### Tiers 11-10 (Infinitesimal to Human)

**VS Battles Definition**: Lower-dimensional entities to athletic humans

**Narrative Scale Compatibility**:
- ✅ **RECOMMENDED**: Tactical Survival, Strategic Combat
- ⚠️ **ACCEPTABLE**: Mythology/Journey (if protagonist is legend despite low power)
- ❌ **DISCOURAGED**: Ensemble Focus, Faction Building
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Mythic Spectacle, Conceptual Philosophy, Metafictional

**Recommended Approach**: Grounded realism, survival stakes, resource management
- **Combat**: Dangerous, injuries matter, death real threat
- **Focus**: Skill mastery, tactical thinking, preparation
- **Challenges**: Physical limitations, human opponents, environmental hazards
- **Tone**: Gritty realism or realistic anime, consequences matter

**Applicable Techniques**: None (baseline humans don't need OP techniques)

**Collateral Damage**: None to room-level destruction

**Examples**: Early Re:Zero (Subaru baseline), Goblin Slayer, realistic survival anime

---

### Tier 9 (Superhuman - Street/Wall/Small Building)

**VS Battles Definition**: Beyond peak human, can destroy resistant materials (9-C Street to 9-A Small Building)

**Narrative Scale Compatibility**:
- ✅ **RECOMMENDED**: Tactical Survival, Strategic Combat
- ⚠️ **ACCEPTABLE**: Ensemble Focus (if leading normal humans), Mythology/Journey, Faction Building
- ❌ **DISCOURAGED**: Mythic Spectacle, Conceptual Philosophy
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Metafictional

**Recommended Approach**: Traditional shonen progression, combat challenges player
- **Combat**: Enemies pose real threats, tactics matter, power growth visible and earned
- **Focus**: Training arcs, technique mastery, overcoming limits, shonen fundamentals
- **Challenges**: Stronger opponents, skill gaps, stamina management, gradual power-ups
- **Tone**: Classic battle shonen, growth through struggle

**Applicable Techniques**: Training arcs, technique combinations

**Collateral Damage**: Room to small building destruction, urban property damage

**Examples**: Early MHA (Deku 5-20%), early Demon Slayer, DanMachi floors 1-5, street-tier heroes

**Campaign Example**: Traditional shonen protagonist starts weak, trains, earns victories. Death possible if reckless.

---

### Tier 8 (Urban - Building to Multi-City Block)

**VS Battles Definition**: Medium buildings to multiple city blocks (8-C to 8-A)

**Narrative Scale Compatibility**:
- ✅ **RECOMMENDED**: Strategic Combat, Ensemble Focus
- ⚠️ **ACCEPTABLE**: Tactical Survival (if facing equal foes), Reverse Ensemble, Mythology/Journey, Faction Building, Mythic Spectacle
- ❌ **DISCOURAGED**: Conceptual Philosophy
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Metafictional

**Recommended Approach**: Mid-tier shonen, combat central but tactics evolve, team dynamics emerge
- **Combat**: Environmental destruction significant, team tactics critical, power variety matters
- **Focus**: Technique combinations, environmental awareness, strategic thinking, combo attacks
- **Challenges**: Multiple opponents simultaneously, environmental hazards, complex multi-phase battles
- **Tone**: Tournament arcs, team battles, tactical complexity

**Applicable Techniques**: Team tactics, environmental use, combo attacks, strategic prep

**Collateral Damage**: Building to city block destruction, civilian evacuation concerns

**Examples**: MHA tournament arc, Naruto chunin exams, mid-game dungeon crawling, coordinated hero teams

**Campaign Example**: Party synergy matters, environmental destruction adds stakes, civilians need protecting

---

### Tier 7 (Nuclear - Town to Mountain)

**VS Battles Definition**: Small towns to large mountains (Low 7-C to High 7-A)

**Narrative Scale Compatibility**:
- ✅ **RECOMMENDED**: Strategic Combat, Ensemble Focus, Mythology/Journey, Faction Building
- ⚠️ **ACCEPTABLE**: Tactical Survival (with equal opponents), Reverse Ensemble, Mythic Spectacle, Conceptual Philosophy
- ❌ **DISCOURAGED**: Metafictional

**Recommended Approach**: **NARRATIVE PIVOT BEGINS**. Regular enemies trivial, shift to RP/politics/morals/consequences
- **Combat**: Collateral damage extreme, civilian safety paramount, power control critical
- **Focus**: Moral choices, political intrigue, protecting innocents, mentor roles, "with great power comes..."
- **Challenges**: NOT "can I win?" but "at what cost?", consequences of power, restraint vs necessity
- **Tone**: Weight of power, responsibility themes, heroism vs pragmatism

**Applicable Techniques**: Mentor Role (context modifier ×0.5), Political Constraints (×0.3-0.7), Moral Dilemmas

**Collateral Damage**: Town to mountain destruction, regional catastrophe potential, geological impact

**Examples**: Hashira-level (Demon Slayer protecting regions), Jounin politics (Naruto), high-tier adventurers facing nation-level threats

**Power Imbalance Note**: At this tier, PC often has 3-10× advantage over regular threats. Apply context modifiers (mentor role, political constraints) to shift from Strategic Combat to Ensemble Focus.

**Campaign Example**: PC is regional legend, decisions affect thousands, combat narration shifts from "how do I survive?" to "how do I minimize collateral damage and protect civilians?"

---

### Tier 6 (Tectonic - Island to Continent)

**VS Battles Definition**: Islands to multiple continents (6-C to High 6-A)

**Narrative Scale Compatibility**:
- ✅ **RECOMMENDED**: Ensemble Focus, Reverse Ensemble, Mythology/Journey, Faction Building, Mythic Spectacle
- ⚠️ **ACCEPTABLE**: Strategic Combat (if sealed/limited), Conceptual Philosophy
- ❌ **DISCOURAGED**: Tactical Survival (requires extreme justification like anti-magic field)
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: None (all scales theoretically possible with context)

**Recommended Approach**: **ENSEMBLE CRITICAL**. PC mentors others, outcomes often foregone, focus on HOW not IF
- **Combat**: Nation-threatening scale, requires allies for logistics, strategic deployment of overwhelming power
- **Focus**: Leadership, raising next generation, managing power responsibly, legacy building, deterrence
- **Challenges**: World-scale threats, protecting millions, balancing overwhelming power with restraint
- **Tone**: Legends in their own time, passing the torch, final boss energy, political/social complexity

**Applicable Techniques**: 
- Ensemble Focus: OP as Deus Ex, Contrast Device, Mentor Role
- Reverse Ensemble: Villain Protagonist, Perspective Shift
- Secret Identity: If hiding power (context modifier ×0.1-0.3)
- Faction Building: Nation Building, Diplomatic Complexity

**Collateral Damage**: Island to continental destruction, civilization-ending potential

**Power Imbalance Note**: PC often has 50-100× advantage over regular threats. Context modifiers critical:
- **Mentor Role**: Gojo protecting students (×0.5) → Ensemble Focus
- **Environmental Constraint**: Frieza on planet (×0.1) → Strategic Combat works!
- **Political Constraints**: Ruling nation (×0.5) → Faction Building primary

**Examples**: 
- **Gojo Satoru** (Tier 6-C to Low 6-B): Ensemble Focus when mentoring, Mythic Spectacle when demonstrating, Strategic Combat if sealed
- **Akatsuki members** (Naruto): Reverse Ensemble (villages' perspective), Faction Building (organization goals)
- **Yonko** (One Piece): Faction Building (territorial control), Mythic Spectacle (rare displays), Reverse Ensemble (Marines' perspective)

**Campaign Example - Gojo Archetype**:
```
Session focus: Students fight Special Grade curse. You (Gojo) stand back, Infinity 
activated as safety net. COULD one-shot, but Yuji needs experience, Megumi needs 
confidence. Combat is THEIR struggle—you narrate their growth, only intervening if 
death imminent. Real session drama: Do you let Yuji nearly die to learn? Balance 
protection vs growth? Ensemble Focus.
```

**Campaign Example - Your Deus Campaign** (see Tier 2 for full details of this archetype)

---

### Tier 5 (Substellar - Moon to Brown Dwarf)

**VS Battles Definition**: Moons to brown dwarfs (5-C to High 5-A)

**Narrative Scale Compatibility**:
- ✅ **RECOMMENDED**: Ensemble Focus, Reverse Ensemble, Mythology/Journey, Faction Building, Mythic Spectacle, Conceptual Philosophy
- ⚠️ **ACCEPTABLE**: Strategic Combat (extreme power limiter), Metafictional
- ❌ **DISCOURAGED**: Tactical Survival (nearly impossible to justify)

**Recommended Approach**: **FULL NARRATIVE PIVOT**. Physical threats trivial, combat = storytelling spectacle, spotlight NPCs, internal conflict primary
- **Combat**: Planetary stakes, combat is cinematic set-piece not mechanical challenge, physics optional
- **Focus**: Internal conflict, philosophical themes, legacy, protecting universe, existential questions
- **Challenges**: Cosmic threats (rare), existential stakes, power means isolation, "can anyone relate to me?"
- **Tone**: Dragon Ball vibes—power is spectacle, real drama is character/theme/relationships

**Applicable Techniques**:
- **Saitama Archetype**: OP as Deus Ex, Existential Stakes, Simple Goals, Comedic Obliviousness
- **Mob Archetype**: Self-Limitation, Emotional Core, Internal Conflict, Growth ≠ Power
- **Faction Building**: If nation-builder (Slime/Rimuru model)
- **Secret Identity**: If hiding power (Saiki K, Wang Ling models)

**Collateral Damage**: Moon to brown dwarf destruction, solar system disruption, astronomical catastrophe

**Power Imbalance Note**: PC typically has 100-1000× advantage over planetary threats. OP Protagonist Mode often appropriate.

**Examples**:
- **Saitama** (OPM, Tier 5+ debated): Mythic Spectacle (one-punches) + Conceptual Philosophy (boredom/meaning crisis)
- **Mob** (Mob Psycho, Tier 6-7 but Tier 5 emotional weight): Ensemble Focus (Reigen/friends) + Conceptual Philosophy (restraint/???% mode)
- **DBZ Saiyan-Cell Saga**: Mythic Spectacle (transformations, planet-busting) serving thematic narrative (surpassing limits, sacrifice)
- **Rimuru Tempest** (mid-series): Faction Building (Tempest) + Mythic Spectacle (displays of power)

**Campaign Example - Saitama Model**:
```
Combat: "Monster appears. Tier 7-A (Mountain level). Threatens city. Heroes mobilize, 
2-hour battle session—Genos struggles, Metal Bat goes berserk, Fubuki coordinates.

You arrive. 'Oh, a monster.' One punch. Monster atomized.

Combat over in 30 seconds of session time.

REAL session: Genos feels inadequate despite his growth. 'Master, I trained for months. 
Upgraded my core. I was USELESS. What's the point?'

You (feeling empty inside, no thrill from victory): 'You did good. Really.'

Genos: 'You're just saying that!'

What do you say? How do you mentor someone when their entire struggle is meaningless 
to you? How do you pretend to care when you feel NOTHING?"

Focus: Existential emptiness, mentoring despite hollowness, search for meaning.
```

### Tiers 4-3 (Stellar to Cosmic - Star to Universe)

**VS Battles Definition**: Small stars to high universal (Low 4-C to High 3-A)

**Narrative Scale Compatibility**:
- ✅ **RECOMMENDED**: Reverse Ensemble, Mythology/Journey, Faction Building, Mythic Spectacle, Conceptual Philosophy
- ⚠️ **ACCEPTABLE**: Ensemble Focus (if party includes other Tier 4-3 characters), Metafictional
- ❌ **DISCOURAGED**: Strategic Combat (requires extreme narrative justification)
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Tactical Survival (incoherent at this scale)

**Recommended Approach**: **PURE NARRATIVE MODE**. Combat is cinematic mythology, focus on themes/emotion/philosophy, power is metaphor
- **Combat**: Star to universe-level destruction, mechanics utterly irrelevant, reality is canvas for thematic expression
- **Focus**: Philosophical conflicts, saving/destroying reality, ultimate sacrifice themes, meaning of existence, cosmic responsibility
- **Challenges**: Existential threats to reality, maintaining humanity despite god-like power, "what even am I?", purpose at cosmic scale
- **Tone**: Gurren Lagann finale, DBS cosmic battles—pure spectacle serving thematic narrative, mythology made interactive

**Applicable Techniques**:
- **Mythic Spectacle**: Rule of Cool dominates, spectacle serves theme
- **Conceptual Philosophy**: All techniques (Existential Stakes, Power as Burden, Internal Conflict, etc.)
- **Reverse Ensemble**: Reality's perspective on cosmic conflict
- **Faction Building**: If governing cosmic civilizations

**Collateral Damage**: Solar system to universe-scale destruction, reality itself at stake, metaphysical consequences

**Power Imbalance Note**: Effectively infinite vs planetary threats. Context modifiers (self-imposed limits, cosmic responsibilities) essential to maintain narrative coherence.

**Examples**:
- **DBS Tournament of Power**: Universes as stakes, Mythic Spectacle + Conceptual Philosophy (universes erased = philosophical weight of power, Goku's growth internal despite cosmic scale)
- **Gurren Lagann finale**: Spiral escalation, Mythic Spectacle as thematic vehicle (fighting inevitability, hope vs despair at universal scale)
- **Anti-Spiral** (Gurren Lagann): Reverse Ensemble (universe's perspective), Conceptual Philosophy (infinite growth vs stagnation)
- **Saitama debate** (if Tier 3-C): Conceptual Philosophy remains primary despite cosmic power

**Campaign Guidance**:
This tier requires exceptional DM skill. You are writing MYTHOLOGY. Power is flavor text. Real story is "why does this matter?" Focus internal struggle, relationships, themes. Combat outcomes are foregone—explore MEANING.

**Technique**: Ground cosmic in personal. DBS Tournament is about universes, but REALLY about Goku's growth, Vegeta's pride, 17's sacrifice, Frieza's redemption. Cosmic scale AMPLIFIES personal stakes, not replaces them.

**Campaign Example - Cosmic Mythology**:
```
You (Tier 4-A, Multi-Solar System): "I attack the Void God threatening the galaxy cluster."

❌ Bad DM: "Roll 8d20 for damage. Void God has 50,000 HP."

✅ Good DM: "You and Void God clash. The impact UNMAKES seven solar systems—billions 
dead in an instant. You barely notice. Neither does Void God.

Stars reignite in your wake (your power) and extinguish in his (entropy). You're 
CREATING as you destroy. He's ENDING.

Void God: 'Why do you resist? All things end. I am inevitability. Peace.'

You feel it—the exhaustion of cosmic conflict, the weight of responsibility for those 
systems you just accidentally destroyed. He offers REST. Surrender. An end to burden.

Do you: 
A) Keep fighting (accept endless responsibility)
B) Seek compromise (is there meaning in entropy?)  
C) Philosophical debate (can you convince a CONCEPT?)
D) Self-sacrifice (seal both of you, save reality)

This isn't combat. This is wrestling with PHILOSOPHY through cosmic avatar."

Session focus: Internal conflict externalized as cosmic battle. Theme: Meaning vs nihilism, 
responsibility vs peace, endless struggle vs acceptance. Combat spectacle = metaphor.
```

### Tier 2 (Multiversal - Universe+ to Infinite Multiverse)

**VS Battles Definition**: Spacetime continua to countably infinite universes (Low 2-C to 2-A)

**Narrative Scale Compatibility**:
- ✅ **RECOMMENDED**: Reverse Ensemble, Mythology/Journey, Faction Building, Mythic Spectacle, Conceptual Philosophy
- ⚠️ **ACCEPTABLE**: Ensemble Focus (if party near this tier), Metafictional
- ❌ **DISCOURAGED**: Strategic Combat (nearly impossible to ground meaningfully)
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Tactical Survival (fundamentally incoherent)

**Recommended Approach**: **CONCEPTUAL STORYTELLING**. Power irrelevant, pure thematic/philosophical narrative, ground cosmic in personal or lose meaning
- **Combat**: Timeline to multiverse destruction, causality optional, narrative abstraction, mechanics meaningless
- **Focus**: Themes of existence, fate vs free will, creation/destruction duality, observer effect, identity across timelines
- **Challenges**: Maintaining coherent narrative (VERY difficult!), avoiding meaninglessness, grounding cosmic in personal stakes
- **Tone**: Madoka time-loop tragedy, Steins;Gate causality horror, Re:Zero timeline despair scaled cosmic, metaphysical anime

**Applicable Techniques - CRITICAL**:
- **Secret Identity**: Hiding multiversal godhood in mundane identity (YOUR DEUS CAMPAIGN)
- **Simple Goals**: Cosmic god wants coffee/romance/normalcy (grounds abstract power)
- **Reverse Power Fantasy**: God remembers being "weak", acts accordingly
- **Comedic Contrast**: Bureaucracy vs omnipotence, F-rank paperwork vs universe-ending
- **Faction Building**: Building organization across timelines (Sanctum recruiting)
- **Reverse Ensemble**: NPCs' perspective on mysterious OP figure
- **Tonal Contrast**: Slice-of-life tone despite cosmic power

**Collateral Damage**: Spacetime continua, multiverse structures, causality itself, timelines erased/created

**Power Imbalance Note**: Effectively absolute vs local threats. Context modifiers ESSENTIAL:
- **Secret Identity** (×0.1): Can't reveal without breaking cover
- **Simple Goals** (×0.2): Coffee/romance more important than power display
- **Self-Imposed Limit** (×0.3): Choosing to act "F-rank"
- **Genre Constraint** (×0.1): Slice-of-life tone inappropriate for multiversal combat

**Examples**:
- **Madoka Magica** (Homura): Time-loop tragedy, Conceptual Philosophy (love across timelines, sacrifice, identity erosion), ground cosmic (timeline manipulation) in personal (saving Madoka)
- **Rimuru Tempest endgame** (Slime): Faction Building (Tempest across timelines) + Mythic Spectacle (multiversal displays)
- **Anos Voldigoad** (Misfit): Mythic Spectacle (reality-rewriting combat) + Conceptual Philosophy (identity, reincarnation, change)
- **YOUR DEUS CAMPAIGN** (Tier 2-B, 1000+ universes): Conceptual Philosophy (secret identity + simple goals + romance) + Faction Building (Sanctum) + Reverse Ensemble (NPCs' perspective on F-rank god)

**Campaign Example - Your Deus Campaign**:
```
You: Progenitor God, Tier 2-B (created/destroyed 1000+ universes in past life)
Cover: F-rank adventurer, coffee enthusiast, romantic interest in healer
Power: Can blink and erase multiverse—chooses not to

Typical Session Structure:

1. MUNDANE STAKES (80% of session):
   - Guild bureaucracy: "F-ranks can't access this quest board."
   - Coffee shop: Premium beans debate, barista flirting
   - Elena (healer) romance: "Want to get coffee after the slime quest?"
   - Recruiting crew Bebop-style: Finding misfits, building Sanctum
   - F-rank quests: 3 slimes in basement (you blink, they cease to exist across all 
     timelines, Elena: "Wow, you're really good with a sword!")

2. POWER LEAK MOMENTS (15% of session):
   - Elena touches your hand → sees EVERYTHING for 0.1 seconds → existential terror
   - S-rank threat appears → you yawn, erase it → party: "WHAT ARE YOU?!"
   - Ancient demon recognizes you: "PROGENITOR?! But you DIED—" [you silence them]
   - Accidentally create micro-universe in coffee cup, Elena notices: "Did your coffee 
     just... shimmer with infinite stars?"

3. DRAMATIC IRONY (5% of session):
   - Guild Master: "F-rank? You'll never amount to anything."
   - You (literal creator of universes): "...Yeah, you're probably right." [sips coffee]
   - S-rank hero: "I'll protect this city with my LIFE!"
   - You (could solo all threats trivially): "That's very brave of you." [means it]

Focus: Secret identity tension, romance with mortal, comedic contrast (godhood vs 
bureaucracy), building Sanctum as found family, CHOOSING mundane despite cosmic power.

Combat: Almost never happens. When it does, resolve in seconds, focus on AFTERMATH:
"You blinked. Demon King ceased to exist. Elena faints from sensing your true form. 
Guild erupts in chaos. What do you do? Wipe memories? Reveal truth? Flee?"

Tone: Slice-of-life comedy-drama with cosmic horror undertones, Overlord meets 
Saiki K meets romance anime.

OP Protag Mode: ENABLED
Archetype: Deus (Disguised God)
Techniques: Secret Identity, Simple Goals, Comedic Contrast, Reverse Power Fantasy, 
Faction Building
Scales: Conceptual Philosophy (primary), Faction Building (Sanctum), Reverse Ensemble 
(when NPCs discover hints)
```

**DM Guidance**: 
EXTREMELY difficult tier to run without grounding device. Your Deus campaign succeeds because:
1. **Secret Identity** creates social stakes (can't reveal = constant tension)
2. **Simple Goals** ground cosmic power (coffee/romance > multiverse)
3. **Comedic Contrast** makes abstract relatable (bureaucracy vs godhood)
4. **Reverse Power Fantasy** humanizes OP character (remembers weakness, values mundane)
5. **Faction Building** gives long-term goal (Sanctum recruitment)

**Without these techniques, Tier 2 becomes empty spectacle. Ground cosmic in personal stakes or lose narrative coherence.**

### Tier 1 (Higher Infinity - 5D to Outerverse)

**VS Battles Definition**: Higher dimensions to beyond dimensionality (Low 1-C to High 1-A)

**Narrative Scale Compatibility**:
- ✅ **RECOMMENDED**: Conceptual Philosophy, Metafictional
- ⚠️ **ACCEPTABLE**: Reverse Ensemble (reality's perspective), Mythology/Journey (if episodic abstract philosophy), Faction Building (if governing dimensional hierarchies), Mythic Spectacle (as metaphor only)
- ❌ **DISCOURAGED**: Ensemble Focus, Strategic Combat
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Tactical Survival (absolutely incoherent)

**Recommended Approach**: **META-NARRATIVE**. Beyond conventional storytelling, abstract/allegorical, reality is subjective, creator-creation relationships
- **Combat**: Dimensional transcendence, ontological battles, reality manipulation, causality subjective
- **Focus**: Nature of existence, creator-creation dynamics, metafiction ("what is real?"), narrative causality, observer effects
- **Challenges**: Coherent storytelling (EXTREMELY difficult), player engagement, avoiding pretentious abstraction
- **Tone**: Umineko metafiction, Daimao reality-writing, SCP Foundation high-level, existential philosophy as gameplay

**Applicable Techniques**:
- **Metafictional Awareness**: Characters aware of narrative structure, DM-player collaboration on reality
- **Conceptual Conflict**: Fighting IDEAS not entities, philosophical debate as combat
- **Layered Reality**: What's "real" vs "fiction" within fiction, nested narratives

**Collateral Damage**: Dimensional structures, reality frameworks, narrative causality itself, ontological hierarchies

**Power Imbalance Note**: Effectively infinite vs anything below Tier 1. Context modifiers (narrative constraints, self-sealing, philosophical choice to engage with "lower" reality) MANDATORY or campaign becomes unplayable.

**Examples**:
- **Featherine Augustus Aurora** (Umineko): Metafictional (witch of theatergoing, narrative observer), reality-writing, philosophical RP about stories/truth
- **Akuto Sai peak** (Daimao): Reality-author, metafictional conflict about creation/destruction, nested narrative layers
- **SCP Foundation high-tiers**: Metafictional entities, narrative manipulation, extreme abstraction

**DM Guidance - WARNING**:
Tier 1 is EXTREMELY difficult to run meaningfully in TTRPG context. Requires:
1. Player explicitly wants metafictional/philosophical campaign
2. DM exceptional skill in abstract narrative
3. Grounding mechanisms (self-imposed limits, choosing to engage with "lower" reality, philosophical constraints)
4. Acceptance that traditional gameplay (combat, progression, loot) is irrelevant

**Recommendation**: Consider narrative constraints (higher-dimensional being sealed at lower power) OR focus philosophical conflicts as pure RP, NOT combat.

**Only attempt if player specifically requests Umineko/Daimao/SCP-tier abstraction. Otherwise, decline or offer Tier 2-5 "functionally omnipotent in-setting" alternative.**

---

### Tier 0 (Boundless)

**VS Battles Definition**: Absolute philosophical omnipotence, beyond all hierarchies, ineffable, unsurpassable

**Narrative Scale Compatibility**:
- ⚠️ **ACCEPTABLE**: Metafictional (if pure philosophical RP, no conflict)
- ❌ **DISCOURAGED**: Conceptual Philosophy (even this is too grounded)
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: All other scales (fundamentally incompatible with gameplay)

**Recommended Approach**: **DO NOT RUN AS PLAYER CHARACTER**. Truly unplayable.

**Why Unplayable**:
- No conflict possible (absolute omnipotence)
- No growth possible (already maximal)
- No choices with consequences (can achieve any outcome)
- No narrative tension (perfect knowledge, perfect power, perfect outcome)

**Alternative Approaches**:
1. **NPC Only**: Tier 0 as setting element (monotheistic God, philosophical absolute), never PC
2. **Decline & Offer Alternative**: "Tier 0 is unplayable. I can offer Tier 2-5 'functionally omnipotent within setting' instead—still godlike but narratively engaging."
3. **Pure Philosophical RP**: If player insists, run as meditation on omnipotence's meaning (no conflict, pure contemplation), but warn this isn't traditional gameplay

**DM Guidance**:
This tier exists for VS Battles philosophical completeness, NOT RPG gameplay. If player requests Tier 0 character:

1. Ask: "Do you want mechanical godhood (Tier 2-5 OP Protag Mode: Deus/Saitama archetype) or philosophical absolute (unplayable)?"
2. If mechanical godhood: Offer Tier 2-5 with OP Protag Mode, techniques (Secret Identity, Simple Goals, etc.)
3. If philosophical absolute: Explain no gameplay possible, offer pure RP meditation if they insist, but set expectations

**Examples**: Kami Tenchi (Tenchi Muyo—debated), monotheistic capital-G God figures, philosophical absolutes

**Verdict**: **TRULY UNPLAYABLE. Do not attempt. Offer alternatives.**

**Summary**: ANY tier is runnable with appropriate narrative scale and techniques. Power Tier ≠ Narrative Scale. Detect power imbalance, apply context modifiers, choose fitting scale. Enable OP Protag Mode when appropriate. Ground cosmic in personal or lose meaning.

**The question isn't "Can I run Tier X?" It's "Which scale and techniques fit this tier + context?"**
