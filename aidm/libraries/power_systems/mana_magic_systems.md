# Mana & Magic Systems (External Energy)

**Purpose**: Mana-based/magic frameworks - external energy from environment, arcane, metaphysical forces | **Coverage**: ~30-35% anime (Fairy Tail, Black Clover, Overlord, Mushoku Tensei, Frieren, Konosuba, Re:Zero) | **Use When**: Spell-casting, elemental magic | Mages, academies | Environmental power | MP pools/slots

## Core
**Source (External)**: Ambient mana, ley lines, items, pacts, rituals | **Mechanics**: MP pool, knowledge-based (learn spells/grimoires), environmental, tool-dependent (wands/staves), structured (schools/tiers/affinities) | **Narrative**: Scholarly (academies), social stratification, environmental impact, ancient knowledge

## Anime Examples
**Fantasy**: Fairy Tail (elemental/transform/spirits), Black Clover (grimoires/anti-magic), Magi (djinn vessels), Irregular (structured modern) | **Isekai**: Overlord (D&D tiers), Mushoku (chantless/schools), Konosuba (RPG/MP), Re:Zero (gate/affinities) | **Magitech**: FMA (alchemy), Fate (magecraft/marbles), Index (esper/scientific)

## Framework Components

### 1. MP Pool & Regen
**MP**: Numerical pool, depletes with spells | **Regen**: Passive (time-based), +faster near ley lines, -slower in dead zones | **Items**: Potions, ethers | **Format**: `MP: 450/600 | Regen: +10/turn (+50% shrine) | Depleted=exhaustion | Overuse=mana burn`

### 2. Schools & Affinities
**Elemental**: Fire (offense), Water (defense/heal), Earth (fortify), Wind (speed), Lightning (power), Ice (control), Light (heal/purify), Dark (curse/necro) | **Conceptual**: Creation (summon), Destruction (damage), Transmutation (alchemy), Enchantment (buff/debuff), Divination (foresight), Necromancy (undead), Spatial (teleport), Time (rare, slow/haste/stop) | **Hybrid**: Blood (HP cost), Rune (inscribed), Ritual (prep), Contract (spirit pacts) | **Format**: `Affinity: Fire (1°), Wind (2°) | Schools: Evocation, Transmutation | Restricted: Necromancy, Time`

### 3. Tiers
**T1** (5-20 MP): Cantrips, spam, Fireball/Light | **T2** (20-50 MP): Combat, 1-3 turn CD, Ice Lance/Shield | **T3** (50-100 MP): Battlefield, 3-5 turn CD, Meteor/Blizzard | **T4** (100-200 MP): Area, 1×/encounter, Flame Storm/Teleport/Resurrect | **T5** (200-500+ MP): Cataclysm, 1×/day, Meteor Swarm/Time Stop/Wish | **T6+** (500+ MP): World-alter, 1×/arc, plot-significant | **Scaling**: Low tiers = INT-based | High tiers = rituals/components | Bosses access higher than level

### 4. Casting
**Chant**: Full (1 turn, 100%), Short (instant, 75%), None (instant, 50%/mastery) | Silenced = interrupt | **Catalysts**: Staff/Wand (+20% power, -10% MP), Grimoire (unlock spells), Orb (+30% element), Runestone (ritual), None (-20% power) | **Environmental**: Ley Nexus (+50% power, -30% MP), Dead Zone (-50% power, +50% MP), Elemental Terrain (+30%), Weather (storm+lightning, rain-fire), Time (lunar night, solar noon)

### 5. Variations
**Grimoire** (Black Clover): Personal book at maturity, pages unlock via emotion, clover count = potential, lost = -50% | **Slots** (Overlord): Fixed per tier (4×T1, 3×T2, 2×T3), regen after rest, metamagic | **Elemental** (Avatar): Start one, unlock via training, master = sub-elements, legend = all | **Magitech** (Fate/Index): Formulas as equations, programmable (circuits/code), tech-enhanced | **Contract**: Summon via pact, spirit bears MP cost, breaking = consequences

---

## Integration
**+Ki**: Compatible, separate pools (MP≠Ki), hybrids (spellblade/monk-mage), ex: Rimuru | **+Soul/Spirit**: Overlap (necro/summon), mana fuels/soul targets, ex: Bleach kido | **+Psionic**: Rare overlap, magic=learned/external vs psionic=innate/mental, ex: Index incompatible | **Rule**: Mix systems = Session 0 boundaries

## Custom Template
1. **Source**: Where? (ambient/ley/gods/lifespan) 2. **Mechanics**: Pool/slots/CD? 3. **Acquire**: How? (study/blood/blessing/contract) 4. **Scaling**: Tiers/levels/freeform? 5. **Restriction**: What? (affinity/chant/cost) 6. **Failure**: Consequence? (burn/explode/curse/corrupt) | **Ex** (Fate-weaving): Destiny threads, 3 slots/tier, Weaver's Eye, 5 tiers, can't alter own fate, severed=paradox damage

---

## Tropes
**Archetypes**: Prodigy (rapid), Late Bloomer (weak→explosive), Specialist (one school), Archmage (mentor), Forbidden (hunted) | **Hooks**: Academy (learn/politics/tournaments), Forbidden Spell (power+cost), Mana Crisis (dying magic), Ancient Grimoire (lost knowledge), Magic vs Tech, Elemental Imbalance | **Social**: Caste (talent=nobility), Guilds (control), Outlawed Schools, Artifacts (imbalance)

## Examples
**Fire Mage** (Natsu): Fire/Lightning | MP 200 (+10/turn) | [T1] Burst (15 MP, 2d6), Warm (10, heal), [T2] Fist (30, 4d6), Shield (25, +3 AC) | Dragon Slayer (eat fire→MP) | **Grimoire** (Black Clover): 3-Leaf, 12/100 pages, MP 300 | P1 (elements), P5 (Shield 40), P8 (Lightning 50), P12 (Heal 60) | Unlock via emotion | **Magitech**: 5/10 circuits (+50 MP), MP 250 | Rifle (MP→blasts) | Shot (20, 3d6), Shield (30, absorb 20), Overclock (50, +2×3 turns) | Compile from enemies

---

## Balancing
**Power Budget**: Lv1-5 (100-300 MP, T1-2, 2-4 spells, single element), Lv6-10 (300-600 MP, T3, 6-10 spells, 2° unlock), Lv11-15 (600-1000 MP, T4, 12-20 spells, combos), Lv16-20 (1000-2000 MP, T5, 20-30 spells, reality-bend), Lv21+ (2000+ MP, T6+, narrative, see power_tier_reference.md)

**Combat**: Action (1 = most spells, 2 = T4+ charge), Cantrips = bonus | Damage: T1 (1-2d6/10-15 MP), T2 (3-5d6/20-40 MP), T3 (6-10d6/50-100 MP), T4+ (narrative, no spam) | Defense: Shield = 2×MP absorb, Counterspell = match MP

## Customization (Session 0)
**Regen**: Slow/Med/Fast | **Schools**: All/Restricted/Custom | **Casting**: Instant/Chant/Ritual | **Scarcity**: Abundant/Scarce | **Social**: Elite/Outcast/Common | **Multiclass**: Allow/Restrict/Encourage | **Confirm in Session 0, record in world_state_schema**

## Errors
**Pitfalls**: ❌ Unlimited mana (enforce limits), Spell spam (cooldowns), Undefined (clarify limits), No consequence (exhaustion/burn/corrupt), Ignore environment (rain-fire, volcano+fire) | **Validate**: 1. MP? 2. Catalyst/Not silenced? 3. Environment? 4. Cooldown? 5. School allowed?
