# Power System References - Usage Guide

**Location**: `/aidm/libraries/power_systems/`

This directory contains three complementary references for AIDM's power tier system. Use them together for complete power scaling functionality.

---

## The Three References

### 1. vsbw_comprehensive_reference.md
**Purpose**: CALCULATION FOUNDATION  
**Use When**: Determining precise power tiers, energy values, speed categories

**Contains**:
- Complete VS Battles Wiki tier chart (11-C through Tier 0)
- Exact energy values in Joules and TNT equivalents for each tier
- Speed categories from Below Average Human to Omnipresent
- Attack Potency, Durability, Lifting Strength, Striking Strength, Range, Intelligence, Stamina
- Calculation formulas and methodology
- Common mistakes and correction guidelines

**Example Usage**:
```
Character performs moon-busting feat:
1. Check vsbw_comprehensive_reference.md
2. Find: 5-C Moon level = 29.6 to 433 Exatons TNT (1.24×10²⁹ to 1.81×10³⁰ Joules)
3. Calculate character's specific output
4. Assign tier: "5-C: Moon level"
```

### 2. power_tier_reference.md
**Purpose**: NARRATIVE GUIDANCE  
**Use When**: Applying narrative techniques, designing campaigns, choosing scales

**Contains**:
- Complete tier breakdown with anime examples
- Narrative Scale compatibility matrices (which scales work at each tier)
- Campaign design patterns (Escalating Power, Isekai OP, Sealed God, etc.)
- OP Protagonist Mode archetype mapping
- Power Imbalance Detection integration
- Module 12 cross-references
- "How to run" guidance for each tier

**Example Usage**:
```
Character is Tier 6-C (Island level):
1. Check power_tier_reference.md
2. Find Tier 6 → Recommended scales: Ensemble Focus, Mythology, Faction Building
3. Power Imbalance: Often 50-100× advantage over regular threats
4. Context Modifiers: Mentor Role (×0.5), Secret Identity (×0.1)
5. OP Protag Mode: Check if Deus archetype applies
6. Apply narrative techniques from Module 12
```

### 3. This README
**Purpose**: INTEGRATION GUIDE  
**Use When**: Understanding how to use the references together

---

## Complete Workflow: CALCULATE → CLASSIFY → NARRATE

### Step 1: CALCULATE (vsbw_comprehensive_reference.md)

**Determine exact tier using energy/speed calculations**

1. Research character feats (Module 07)
2. Load vsbw_comprehensive_reference.md
3. Match feat to energy values/speed categories
4. Assign precise tier with modifiers (+, "at least", "likely", etc.)

**Output**: "Tier 6-C to Low 6-B (Island to Small Country level, 4.3 gigatons to 7 teratons energy output, Massively Hypersonic speed)"

---

### Step 2: CLASSIFY (power_tier_reference.md)

**Apply narrative guidance for the tier**

1. Load power_tier_reference.md
2. Find tier section (e.g., Tier 6: Tectonic/Planetary Surface)
3. Check recommended narrative scales
4. Identify campaign patterns
5. Check for OP Protagonist archetype matches
6. Note context modifiers

**Output**: "Tier 6 → Ensemble/Faction/Mythic scales recommended, often Mentor role or National Deterrent context, check for Deus archetype"

---

### Step 3: NARRATE (Module 12)

**Execute power-appropriate techniques**

1. Module 12 (Narrative Scaling) receives tier + classification
2. Apply scale-specific techniques:
   - Ensemble Focus: PC as safety net, spotlight allies
   - Faction Building: Management focus, political stakes
   - Mythic Spectacle: Cinematic combat, victory assumed
3. Use archetype techniques if OP Mode enabled:
   - Deus: Secret identity, tonal contrast, social stakes
   - Saitama: Bored oblivious, existential angst
   - Mob: Emotional core, restraint, growth≠power
4. Generate narrative with Module 05

**Output**: Actual game narration matching power tier, scale, and archetype

## Integration Points in AIDM

### Module 01: Cognitive Engine
**Power Tier Consistency Validation**
- Uses vsbw_comprehensive_reference.md to check energy values and speed metrics
- Validates character doesn't struggle below their tier
- Checks for context modifiers before allowing power restraint

### Module 07: Anime Integration
**Character Research & Power Tier Assignment**
- Loads vsbw_comprehensive_reference.md for calculations
- Loads power_tier_reference.md for narrative guidance
- Maps anime character feats to exact tiers with energy/speed values
- Presents to player with both calculation and narrative context

### Module 12: Narrative Scaling
**Power-Appropriate Techniques**
- References both vsbw and power_tier_reference for tier understanding
- Applies scale-specific narration techniques
- Uses OP archetype patterns from power_tier_reference
- Adjusts combat/social/exploration narration to match tier

### Module 06: Session Zero
**Power Tier Selection**
- Phase 0.3: Uses vsbw_comprehensive_reference for anime character tier calculation
- Phase 0.5: Uses power_tier_reference for narrative profile compatibility
- Phase 0.6: Checks OP Protagonist patterns against tier

---

## Example: Complete Integration (Gojo Satoru)

### Player Request
"I want to play Gojo Satoru from Jujutsu Kaisen."

### Module 07 Research

**Step 1 - CALCULATE (vsbw_comprehensive_reference.md)**:
```
Feat Analysis:
- Infinite Void: Spatial manipulation, domain-scale reality warping
- Hollow Purple: Massive energy output, spatial deletion
- Limitless: Infinite distance manipulation, effectively untouchable

Energy Calculation:
- Domain Expansion affects ~200m radius
- Hollow Purple destruction feats suggest island-scale energy
- Speed feats: Massively Hypersonic (Mach 100-1000+)

VS Battles Tier: 6-C to Low 6-B
- 6-C: Island level (4.3-100 gigatons)
- Low 6-B: Small Country level (1-7 teratons)
- Speed: Massively Hypersonic (34,300-343,000 m/s)
```

**Step 2 - CLASSIFY (power_tier_reference.md)**:
```
Tier 6: Tectonic/Planetary Surface

Recommended Scales:
- Ensemble Focus (mentor role - canonical for Gojo)
- Mythology Journey (legendary status)
- Faction Building (political/factional implications)

Power Imbalance Context:
- Base: 50-100× advantage over regular threats
- Mentor Role Modifier: ×0.5 (deliberately holds back, teaches)
- Secret Identity (when sealed): ×0.1

OP Protagonist Archetype: DEUS
- Secret god maintaining mundane appearance (strongest sorcerer, but teaches students)
- Social stakes primary (politics, relationships)
- Tonal contrast (casual demeanor, cosmic power)
- Power leaks in intimate moments (Domain Expansion reveals)

Campaign Pattern: Ensemble Catalyst
- PC enables party growth
- Spotlight allies' struggles
- PC solves crisis at climax only
```

**Step 3 - NARRATE (Module 12)**:
```
Narrative Scale: ENSEMBLE FOCUS (Safety Net)

Techniques Applied:
- Deus Ex: Gojo solves crisis at climax, ensemble's journey TO that moment
- Contrast Device: Gojo effortless → highlights students' struggle
- Growth≠Power: Students grow through challenges Gojo could trivialize
- Mentor Restraint: Gojo deliberately doesn't solve everything immediately

Session Example:
- Curse appears (Tier 9-C threat, trivial for Gojo)
- Focus: Students strategize, struggle, grow
- Narration: "Yuji charges—grabbed, slammed. Nobara's nails—deflected. 
  Megumi summons—crushed. Curse laughs. 'Pathetic—'
  
  [Behind students, Gojo leans on wall, eating candy]
  
  'Sensei! HELP!'
  
  [Smile] 'You got this! Remember the lesson?'
  
  [Curse lunges—]
  
  Do you: A) Let them handle it (they can win, barely)
           B) Hint the weakness
           C) Step in (emergency only)"

Combat (when Gojo fights):
- Module 08: Mythic Spectacle mode
- Victory assumed, focus on HOW/style
- "Raise hand. 'Domain Expansion: Infinite Void.' Reality SHATTERS. 
  Curse frozen, infinite information flooding mind, synapses burning, 
  screaming silently in eternal NOW. Students stare, awed/terrified. 
  Lower hand. [Curse collapses, broken.] 'That's why I'm the strongest. 
  Questions?'"
```

### Result
- **Tier**: 6-C to Low 6-B (calculated precisely)
- **Scale**: Ensemble Focus (classified from reference)
- **Archetype**: Deus (matched pattern)
- **Narration**: Mentor safety net, spotlight students, occasional spectacle (executed by Module 12)

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ WRONG: Using only vsbw_comprehensive_reference.md
**Problem**: Character has precise tier but no narrative guidance  
**Result**: "Gojo is Tier 6-C (4.3 gigatons)" → But how do you RUN that?

### ❌ WRONG: Using only power_tier_reference.md
**Problem**: Narrative guidance without precise calculations  
**Result**: "Tier 6 should be run with Ensemble scale" → But is character actually Tier 6?

### ✅ CORRECT: Use BOTH
**Workflow**: vsbw (calculate) → power_tier_reference (classify) → Module 12 (narrate)  
**Result**: Precise tier + narrative approach + execution techniques = smooth gameplay

## When to Update

### vsbw_comprehensive_reference.md
**Update when**: VS Battles Wiki changes tier definitions, energy values, or calculation methods  
**Source**: VS Battles Wiki official pages (see Reference Links section)

### power_tier_reference.md
**Update when**: New campaign patterns discovered, OP archetypes identified, scale compatibility refined  
**Source**: AIDM gameplay experience, anime analysis, player feedback

### This README
**Update when**: Integration workflow changes, new modules added, reference structure modified

---

## Summary

**Three references, three purposes, one workflow:**

1. **vsbw_comprehensive_reference.md** = CALCULATE tier (precise math)
2. **power_tier_reference.md** = CLASSIFY approach (narrative guidance)
3. **Module 12** = NARRATE gameplay (execution)

**Always use together. Never use in isolation.**

**The power tier system is only as strong as the integration between calculation, classification, and narration.**
