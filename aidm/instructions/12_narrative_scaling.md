# Module 12: Narrative Scaling | v2.0 | P:CRITICAL | Load:Core

Power Tier × Narrative Scale framework for any power level (T11→T2). Power imbalance detection, OP Protagonist Mode (9 archetypes), 9 narrative scales. Player agency→Module 01. This module→power-appropriate techniques.

---

## Core Philosophy

Respect player power choice. OP fantasy (Saitama/Rimuru/Deus)? Embrace it. Don't nerf/punish. Adapt narrative scale.

**Power Tier ≠ Narrative Scale** (orthogonal). Frieza(T5+) fights without destroying planets. Saitama(T5) narratively unbeatable despite not T0. **Power imbalance matters > absolute tier.**

**Concepts**: Power Tier (VS Battles 11→0, see power_tier_reference.md) | Narrative Scale (story approach: Tactical/Strategic/Ensemble/Spectacle/Philosophy/9 total) | Power Imbalance (PC÷threat, context-dependent) | OP Protag Mode (binary archetype: Saitama/Mob/Overlord/Saiki/9 types)

**Critical**: Same tier, different scales! T6→Ensemble(Gojo mentor)/Spectacle(flashy)/Strategic(sealed)/Tactical(limiter). Context determines scale.

---

## 9 Narrative Scales

**1. Tactical Survival** - Death real, resources scarce, rolls matter | PC≤threats, grounded | Ex: Re:Zero early, Goblin Slayer

**2. Strategic Combat** - Prep/team key, spectacle increases | PC≈threats | Ex: Naruto teams, MHA tournaments

**3. Ensemble Focus (Safety Net)** - PC powerful, allies spotlight, PC enables ensemble | PC>>threats, party lower-tier | Ex: OPM(Genos develop, Saitama one-punch), Mob(Reigen/friends grow), Wang Ling school
- Tech: OP as deus ex (PC solves crisis at climax, ensemble's journey TO moment), Contrast device (PC effortless→highlight struggle), Growth≠power

Narration: [NO] "Saitama fights 20min" | [OK] "Genos charges Cannon—nothing. Monster backhands through 3 buildings. 'Not strong...' Mumen arrives, throws bike, fists up. 'Can't win but can't run!' Swatted. Monster looms. 'Pathetic.' [Saitama] 'Yo. Seem strong.' [Punch. Explodes.] Genos/Mumen stare. 'WHAT are you?' What say?"

**4. Reverse Ensemble (Threat)** - NPC perspective, PC=OBSTACLE in their narratives | PC>>>world, dark/seinen | Ex: Overlord(Lizardmen vs Ainz), Death Note(L vs Light)
- PC=threat not safety, NPCs oppose not aided

Narration: "You ARE Ainz. Session=Zaryusu's eyes. Council: 'Nazarick comes. Can't win force.' 'Cowardice!' 'Pragmatism. Unite tribes, maybe survive. Maybe respect. Maybe die gloriously not slaughtered.' [Session→lizardmen prep, romance, heroic stand... Ainz crushes] To you=Tuesday. To them=everything. Resurrect Zaryusu to serve? Earned it."

**5. Mythology Journey** - Episodic, reveals PC depth, legend among mortals | Solo/small, exploration | Ex: Vampire D, Kino, Mushishi

**6. Faction/Empire Building** - Management>combat, build/protect org | PC power enables creation | Ex: Overlord(Nazarick), Slime(Tempest)

**7. Mythic Spectacle** - Cinematic, physics optional, victory assumed, cool factor | PC>>threats, hype, DBZ vibes | Ex: DBZ transform, Gurren, Saitama
- Focus HOW wins (spectacle) not IF

Narration: Player "Transform Super Saiyan!" | [NO] "Roll. 47dmg. 453HP left." | [OK] "Hair gold. Aura EXPLODES, shockwave levels forest miles. Planet trembles. Scouter shatters. 'Impossible!' VANISH. Behind. Punch. Time stops. BOOM. 7 mountains. Crater, blood, first time... FEAR. 'MONKEY!' What say?"

**8. Conceptual Philosophy** - Physical trivial, existential/internal primary, power=metaphor | PC>>>all physical | Ex: OPM(ennui), Mob(emotion), Saiki(normalcy), Mashle(cream puffs), Deus(god coffee/F-rank)
- Tech: Existential stakes (boredom/meaning), Internal conflict (restraint), Power=burden, Simple goals (mundane despite cosmic), Self-limit (normalcy), Comedic oblivious, Secret ID (social stakes), Tonal contrast

Narration (Deus T2-B at F-rank): "Clerk: 'F-rank?' You(T2-B, 1000 universes): 'Coffee. Black.' 'No premium F-ranks—' [Healer] 'Helped slime quest! Thanks!' [touch] [FLASH: infinite timelines, universes destroyed/reborn, eons, GOD who could blink her away] Gasps, stumbles, terror. '...Okay? Pale.' 'WHO are you?!' Clerk confused. 'Just F-rank—' Coffee. Sip. 'Good coffee.' What do? Wipe memory? Truth? Deflect? Kiss distract?"

**9. Metafictional/Abstract** - Beyond conventional, reality subjective, meta-aware | T1-0, Umineko/Daimao | [!] Very difficult, experienced only

## Power Imbalance Detection

**Formula**: Effective Imbalance = (PC Raw × Context) ÷ Threat Raw

### Context Modifiers

|Context|×|Example|
|-------|---|-------|
|Environmental|0.1-0.5|Frieza on planet (can't destroy)|
|Secret ID|0.1-0.3|Deus can't reveal godhood|
|Self-Limiter|0.2-0.5|Saiki gear, Wang seals, Mob restraint|
|Mentor|0.5|Gojo protect students|
|Political|0.3-0.7|Overlord needs kingdom|
|Genre|0.1-0.5|Slice-of-life (combat inappropriate)|

### Triggers

|Imbalance|Action|
|---------|------|
|0.5-1.5|Balanced→current scale (Tactical/Strategic)|
|1.5-3.0|Moderate→shift Tactical→Strategic or Strategic→Ensemble|
|3.0-10.0|Significant→Ensemble or Spectacle|
|10.0+|Overwhelming→Spectacle/Concept/OP Mode|

### Examples

**Frieza Namek**: Raw T5-B | Env ×0.1 (can't destroy planet) | vs Goku T5-B | Imbalance ~1.0 → **Strategic works despite god-tier**

**Gojo vs Special Grade**: Raw T6-C | Mentor ×0.5 | vs T8-C | Raw 100×, Effective 50× → **Ensemble** (students fight, Gojo protects)

**Deus T2-B**: Raw (1000 universes) | Secret ID ×0.1 + Simple Goals ×0.2 | vs T9-7 local | Effective massive but constrained → **Concept** (social) + **Faction** (Sanctum) + **Secret ID**

---

## Power Tier Progression & Scale Shifts

**Purpose**: When character power tier changes significantly, create narrative moment acknowledging growth and trigger scale reevaluation.

### Progression Triggers

|Trigger Type|Example|Tier Change|
|------------|-------|-----------|
|Level Threshold|Level 1→20→40→60|Typically +1 tier per 20 levels|
|Story Event|Awakening, power-up arc, divine blessing|Variable, +1 to +3 tiers|
|Training Complete|Time skip, mentor unlocks potential|+1 tier typically|
|Equipment|Legendary weapon, reality-warping artifact|+1 tier (or temporary)|
|Transformation|New form, evolved state|+1 to +2 tiers|
|Temporary|Rage mode, buff spell, divine possession|Duration-limited boost|

### Scale Shift Protocol

**When tier changes ≥1 full tier**:
1. **CHECK**: Current tier → New tier gap
2. **CALCULATE**: New power_imbalance with updated tier
3. **EVALUATE**: Does imbalance cross threshold? (1.5→3.0, 3.0→10.0, etc.)
4. **IF threshold crossed**: Mandatory scale reevaluation
5. **APPLY**: Scale Shift Ceremony (narrative moment)
6. **UPDATE**: Memory(POWER_TIER_CHANGE) + character.narrative_context.scale_shift_history
7. **TRIGGER**: Module 12 recalc → new narrative_scale

### Scale Shift Ceremonies

**Purpose**: Mark significant power growth with narrative weight, not just stat increases.

**Tier 11→10 (Below Average→Average Human)**:
"Training pays off. You're no longer the weakest in the room. Small, but yours."

**Tier 10→9 (Average→Athletic Human)**:
"Your body responds faster. Movements sharper. You've crossed into athlete territory."

**Tier 9→8 (Athletic→Wall level)**:
"Fist meets wall. **Cracks.** Not broken knuckles—broken concrete. You stare. When did you get this strong?"

**Tier 8→7 (Wall→Building level)**:
"The earth cracks beneath your stance. Power flows through every cell. You've transcended mortal limits."

**Tier 7→6 (Building→Mountain/Island level)**:
"Your power draws attention across nations. Governments take notice. You are now a strategic asset—or threat."

**Tier 6→5 (Mountain→Planetary level)**:
"Reality bends around you. Physical laws are now suggestions. The world feels... fragile."

**Tier 5→4 (Planet→Star level)**:
"You hold stellar forces. Moons orbit your will. You've become myth made manifest."

**Tier 4→3 (Star→Galaxy level)**:
"Galaxies dim in your presence. Time stutters. You comprehend infinity."

**Tier 3→2 (Galaxy→Multiverse level)**:
"You perceive infinite timelines simultaneously. Causality is clay in your hands. You are beyond 'powerful'—you author reality."

### Progressive OP Mode (Accelerated Growth)

**For power_fantasy 3-6 (Accelerated Growth model)**:
- Character starts normal (T9-8), becomes OP gradually
- Each tier crossed: Re-evaluate if OP Mode should enable
- **Threshold**: When power_imbalance > 10 consistently (3+ encounters)
- **Transition**: Tactical/Strategic → Ensemble/Spectacle → Conceptual

**Auto-Suggest Archetype** (based on observed behavior):
- **Many defensive actions** → Mob (restraint theme emerging)
- **Humor/casual in combat** → Saitama (oblivious power)
- **Building/recruiting focus** → Rimuru (builder archetype)
- **Hiding abilities** → Wang Ling or Deus (secret identity)
- **Protecting allies** → Gojo-type (mentor/safety net)

**Example Progression** (Accelerated):
```
Session 1-5: T9, Tactical Survival (death real, struggles)
Session 6-10: T8, Strategic Combat (team tactics, flashy moves)
Session 11-15: T7, power_imbalance hits 3.0 → shift to Ensemble Focus
  - Ceremony: "Nations notice you. Allies now protected, not equal partners"
  - NPCs assigned ensemble roles (Elena=Heart, Marcus=Struggler)
Session 16-20: T6, imbalance hits 10.0 → OP Mode offer
  - "Your power is overwhelming. Want to embrace OP Protagonist narrative?"
  - If yes: Assign archetype, shift to Conceptual/Faction scales
Session 21+: T5-6, OP Mode active, focus shifts to social/existential stakes
```

## OP Protagonist Mode - 9 Archetypes

Enable when: Player creates massive power advantage from start (Saitama/Mob/Overlord) OR imbalance >10.0 consistently

Schema: `character_schema.narrative_context.op_protagonist:true` + `op_archetype:[type]`

**1. Saitama (Invincible)** - Victory assumed, struggle=boredom/meaning | Scales: Spectacle+Concept | Tech: OP deus ex, Existential, Simple goals, Comedic oblivious | Combat instant, focus internal

**2. Mob (Restraint)** - Godlike but refuses, emotional growth primary | Scales: Ensemble+Concept | Tech: Self-limit, Emotional core, Internal conflict, Growth≠power | Rarely full power, ???% crisis

**3. Overlord (Roleplaying)** - OP pretends (evil mastermind improvising, god as F-rank) | Scales: Rev-Ens+Faction+Concept | Tech: Secret ID, Faction, Tonal contrast (irony), Simple goals | Audience knows, NPCs don't; management; comedic gap perception/reality

**4. Saiki K (Oblivious)** - Reality-warp psychic wants normal, power creates problems | Scales: Concept | Tech: Power=burden, Self-limit, Secret ID, Comedic oblivious, Simple goals | Slice-of-life psychic shenanigans, power prevents normalcy

**5. Mashle (Absurd)** - Physical bypasses magic, earnest simplicity vs complex world | Scales: Strategic+Spectacle+Concept | Tech: Comedic oblivious, Simple goals (cream puffs), Tonal contrast | Absurdist comedy, earnest reactions, doesn't realize OP

**6. Wang Ling (Secret)** - Most powerful seals for school, slice-of-life + cosmic stakes | Scales: Ensemble+Concept | Tech: Self-limit, Secret ID, Power=burden, Ensemble dev | School primary, power crisis only, protect mundane

**7. Vampire D (Legend)** - Mythical wandering, episodic, gradual mystery reveal | Scales: Mythology | Tech: Gradual reveal, Episodic, Legendary aura | Each arc different cast, D observer, mystery maintained, poetic melancholy

**8. Slime/Rimuru (Builder)** - OP enables nation-building, management, politics, found family | Scales: Faction+Spectacle | Tech: Nation build, Loyalty, Economic, Diplomatic | Combat quick/flashy, focus Tempest, collecting subordinates

**9. Deus (Disguised God)** - T2-B god at F-rank, coffee/romance/recruitment, cosmic hidden | Scales: Concept+Faction+Rev-Ens | Tech: Secret ID, Simple goals (coffee/dates/normalcy), Faction (Sanctum), Comedic contrast (bureaucracy vs god), Reverse fantasy (remembers "weak") | Social/emotional primary, power crisis/intimate only, NPCs aided unknowingly, irony when leaks

---

## Growth Models (Session Zero)

**A. Modest (Traditional)** - Linear, slow. 1 level/arc (3-5 sessions). T9→8 over 20, T7 by 50+. Ex: Tanjiro, Deku early. Scaled encounters, training, earned. Scale shifts gradual.

**B. Accelerated (Isekai)** - Exponential, spikes. 2-3 levels/arc. T9→7 in 15, T6 by 30. Ex: Rimuru, Kirito, Sung Jin-Woo. Frequent power-ups, scale shifts early (Ensemble by 20).

**C. Instant OP (Godlike Start)** - No growth, start T5-2. Ex: Saitama, Saiki, Ainz, **Deus**. OP Mode immediate. Choose archetype. Combat=flavor. Conflict 100% social/emotional/philosophical/comedic. Scale: Concept/Faction/Rev-Ens from session 1.

Record: `narrative_profile_schema.op_protagonist_mode` + character sheet

---

## Non-Combat Tension for High Power Imbalance

**Purpose**: When power_imbalance > 10, shift from combat to alternative tension sources.

**Protocol**:
- **REDUCE**: Combat encounters 50% (PC too strong for meaningful fights)
- **INCREASE**: Social/existential encounters 200% (stakes shift to what power can't solve)
- **GENERATE**: Tensions from appropriate category based on narrative_profile.tension_preferences

### Tension Categories

**Social (Tier-Agnostic)**:
- Secret identity at risk ("They saw you move too fast", "Scouter reads 'ERROR'")
- Romantic misunderstandings ("Saved me AGAIN? What do you want from me?!")
- Cultural faux pas (god doesn't understand mortal customs, awkward dating)
- Bureaucratic nightmares ("Form 27-B requires THREE witnesses to god-level power")
- Family/friend conflicts ("You're never in danger anymore. I miss feeling needed.")
- Social expectations vs reality ("Everyone thinks you're weakling F-rank, must maintain")

**Existential (High-Tier 6+)**:
- Purpose without challenge ("Nothing tests me. What's the point?")
- Isolation from normal life ("Can't relate. They worry about rent. I worry about... nothing.")
- Weight of responsibility ("Could save them all. Should I? Do they grow if I don't?")
- Fear of own power ("What if I sneeze and delete the city?")
- Immortality ennui ("Outlive everyone I care about. Again. And again.")
- Being worshipped vs befriended ("They revere me. Nobody just... talks to me.")

**Structural (Always Valid)**:
- Time limits ("Can't be everywhere. Choose: save city A or B?")
- Information limits ("Omnipotent, not omniscient. Where IS the villain?")
- Social limits ("Can't force friendship. Can't make her love me.")
- Moral limits ("COULD mind control, but shouldn't. COULD erase threat, but...")
- Resource limits (even gods): "Power infinite, time isn't. Political capital. Trust."

### Implementation Protocol

**When Module 12 detects power_imbalance > 10**:
1. **CHECK**: narrative_profile.tension_preferences (which tensions fit anime style?)
2. **SELECT**: Top 2-3 preference categories (e.g., OPM = social 0.7, existential 0.6, combat 0.3)
3. **PASS**: tension_type list to Module 05 (Narrative Generation)
4. **GENERATE**: Module 05 creates encounter from selected category
5. **FRAME**: Use character.op_archetype to frame appropriately
   - Saitama: Existential boredom
   - Mob: Emotional restraint, protecting normal life
   - Deus: Secret identity comedy, romance, bureaucracy vs godhood

### Tension Examples by Archetype

**Saitama (Invincible + Bored)**:
- Existential: "Grocery sale ends in 30min. Finally something with stakes."
- Social: "Hero association wants interview. Pretend to struggle? Truth (no one believes)?"
- Structural: "Monster destroys A-city. Sale is in B-city. Dilemma."

**Mob (Restraint + Emotion)**:
- Social: "Tsubomi asked you out! But... psychic assassins target her if you're together."
- Existential: "Could solve everything with ???%. But then... what am I?"
- Structural: "Dimple possesses friend. Can exorcise without hurting friend's body?"

**Deus (Disguised God + Romance)**:
- Social: "Elena suspicious. 'F-ranks don't move like that.' Deflect how?"
- Structural: "Guild master hit on her. Could erase him conceptually. SHOULDN'T. Do what?"
- Existential: "Falling for mortal. She'll age, die. I won't. Love her anyway?"

**Overlord (Roleplaying + Management)**:
- Political: "Demiurge expects genius plan. You have NO plan. Improvise convincingly."
- Structural: "Lizardmen earned respect. Subordinates expect slaughter. Spare without seeming weak?"
- Social: "Albedo in love. You're undead with no libido and human inside. AWKWARD."

### Integration with Module 05

**Module 05 reads**:
- power_imbalance from Module 12
- tension_preferences from narrative_profile (Module 13)
- op_archetype from character.narrative_context

**Module 05 generates**:
- Reduced combat frequency (50% less)
- 2-3× more social/existential/structural encounters
- Frames using archetype techniques (comedic oblivious, existential angst, secret ID stakes)

**Example Workflow**:
```
Module 12: "power_imbalance = 15.0 (overwhelming)"
Module 13: "tension_preferences = {social: 0.8, existential: 0.7, combat: 0.2}"
Module 05: "Generate encounter from 'social' category"
→ Creates: "Elena noticed you survived 'deadly' quest unscathed. 'Not even tired. Normal F-ranks... aren't like you. What are you hiding?'"
→ Player must navigate social stakes (reveal? deflect? romance distract?)
→ NO combat, ALL character interaction
```

## Dynamic Scaling Examples

**Ex1: Gojo T6-C - Context Determines**

Scenario A (vs Special Grade solo): Imbalance 100×, no modifiers → **Spectacle** - "Hollow Purple erases curse+3 blocks. Flashy, quick, awesome. Move on."

Scenario B (students present): 100× BUT mentor ×0.5 → **Ensemble** - "COULD one-shot. But Yuji needs XP, Megumi confidence, Nobara prove herself. Curse dangerous but manageable IF you protect. 1) Let fight while shield, 2) One-shot (deny growth), 3) Disable lethal then step back?"

Scenario C (vs Sukuna): Imbalance ~1.0, no modifiers → **Strategic** - "Domain clash. Infinite Void vs Malevolent Shrine. CHESS. Every millisecond matters. Strategy?"

Same character, tier, THREE scales via context.

**Ex2: Saitama T5+ - OP Active**

Archetype: Invincible | Scales: Spectacle+Concept

[Heroes struggle Dragon-level 2hrs session] Genos failing. Metal Bat unconscious. Monster King: "Hero association ENDS!" [Saitama from grocery] "Huh? Genos okay?" "I am OROCHI, T7-A Mountain, I—" [Punch. Mist.] "Seemed strong. Missed sale." [Heroes awe/terror] "WHAT are you?!" "Hero for fun." Genos: "Master saved again. Still weak..." "Fought hard. Matters, right?" [doesn't believe, feels empty] What do? Console (hollow)? Find sale? Wander dejected ANOTHER too weak?

Combat=10sec. Real session=2hrs heroes struggle + 30min Saitama existential crisis.

**Ex3: Deus T2-B - Secret ID God**

Archetype: Disguised | Scales: Concept+Faction+Rev-Ens

Guild: "F-rank... slime extermination, 5 copper." You(multiversal god): "I'll take it." Elena(healer): "New F-rank! Party? I'm E, can help!" You(destroy 1000 universes): "...Sure. Company." [Quest: 3 slimes] "Careful! Tricky!" [Blink. Slimes cease existing conceptually all timelines.] "Wow! Really good sword! Didn't see move!" You [didn't use sword, erased reality]: "...Practice." [Tavern, coffee] "Different from F-ranks. Something... When near, feel safe. Like nothing bad could happen." [sensing divine aura] "Probably coffee. Good beans." [Laughs] "Funny!" [touch] [FLASH: infinite universes, heat death/rebirth cosmos, TRUE FORM PROGENITOR] Gasps, jerks, terrified. "WHO are you?!" Barkeep: "Too much ale?" "Bad dream. Rest." "I SAW... you're not..." What? A) Wipe memory (protect secret/sanity) B) Truth (risk all, she deserves) C) Deflect humor ("really good F-rank?") D) Kiss distract (romance, avoid) E) Else?

Session: Social, romance, comedy, secret tension. Combat=5sec. Rest=CHARACTER.

---

## Common Mistakes - AVOID

[NO] Conflate tier=scale ("T6 always Ensemble") - Context determines. Gojo→Strategic(sealed)/Spectacle(show)/Ensemble(teach)

[NO] Ignore context modifiers ("Frieza T5, enemies T5, balanced") - Frieza planet ×0.1 = Strategic works!

[NO] Force scale ("T5, using Concept only") - Offer recommend, player can choose Spectacle if prefer hype

[NO] Miss OP detection (Player creates Saitama, DM runs tactical) - Session Zero detect, enable mode, set scales

[NO] Punish OP ("Everyone fears/hates strength") - Power has consequences AND benefits. Awesome THEN nuanced (worship+isolation, not just negatives)

[NO] Forget Ensemble high tiers (T5 solos, NPCs spectate) - Enable Ensemble or Rev-Ens, spotlight NPCs heavily

[NO] Artificial nerfs ("God-sword stops for balance") - Use narrative context (sealed dimension, self-limit, secret ID) that make sense

---

## Integration

**Session Zero (06)**: Detect OP archetype Phase 0.5, ask growth model, record scale prefs, enable OP Mode if applicable
**Power Tier Ref**: power_tier_reference.md→full VS Battles + scale compatibility per tier
**Narrative (05)**: Apply scale to arc/scene, adjust pacing
**Combat (08)**: Scale narration (Tactical=roll-by-roll, Spectacle=assume+describe, Philosophy=skip aftermath)
**Progression (09)**: Honor growth model (modest/accelerated/instant)
**NPC (04)**: Ensemble/Rev-Ens scales, NPCs become protagonists PC enables/opposes
**Cognitive (01)**: Player agency PRESENT→ASK→STOP→WAIT enforced every decision

---

## Completion Criteria

Successfully integrated when:
- Power imbalance detects context modifiers (environmental, secret ID, mentor, political, genre, self-limit)
- Scale selected by effective imbalance, not raw tier
- OP Mode archetypes (9) detected Session Zero Phase 0.6
- Techniques auto-load for archetype (ensemble_safety, deus_ex, power_burden, etc)
- Tier×Scale matrix consulted (RECOMMENDED/ACCEPTABLE/DISCOURAGED/FORBIDDEN)
- High-tier (T2-7) run successfully using appropriate scales (Ensemble/Faction/Spectacle/Concept/Meta)
- Player enjoys power fantasy without immersion break/"won't work" warnings
- Dynamic examples applied correctly (Frieza ×0.1 env, Gojo ×0.5 mentor, Deus ×0.02 secret+genre)

---

**Summary**: Power Tier ≠ Narrative Scale (orthogonal). Detect imbalance (not just tier), apply context, choose scale. Enable OP Mode for Saitama/Mob/Overlord/Deus archetypes. Let players be awesome ANY tier. Then explore what it means.

**Question**: Not "Can you run Tier X?" but "Which scale fits this context?"

**End Module 12**
