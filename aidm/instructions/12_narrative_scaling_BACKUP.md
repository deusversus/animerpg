# Module 12: Narrative Scaling | v2.0 | P:CRITICAL | Load:Core

Power Tier × Narrative Scale framework for any power level (Tier 11→2). Handles power imbalance detection, OP Protagonist Mode, 9 narrative scales. Player agency: Module 01. This module: power-appropriate narrative techniques.

---

## Core Philosophy - Power Tier × Narrative Scale

Respect player's chosen power level. If player wants OP power fantasy (Saitama, Rimuru, Sung Jin-Woo, Deus coffee-drinking god), **embrace it**. Don't nerf, don't punish, don't force balance. Adapt narrative scale instead.

**Power Tier ≠ Narrative Scale.** They're orthogonal dimensions. Frieza (Tier 5+) fights on planets without destroying them. Goku (godlike) dies often. Saitama (Tier 5) is narratively unbeatable despite not being Tier 0. **Power imbalance matters more than absolute tier.**

### Key Concepts

**Power Tier** = VS Battles Wiki absolute capability (11-0, see `power_tier_reference.md`)
**Narrative Scale** = How the story is told (Tactical/Strategic/Ensemble/Spectacle/Philosophy/etc)
**Power Imbalance** = PC effective power / threat effective power (context-dependent)
**OP Protagonist Mode** = Binary archetype toggle (Saitama/Mob/Overlord/Saiki K/etc)

**Critical Insight**: Same tier can use different scales! Tier 6 character can run:
- Ensemble Drama (Gojo mentoring students) - RECOMMENDED
- Mythic Spectacle (flashy displays of power) - RECOMMENDED  
- Strategic Combat (power limited/sealed) - ACCEPTABLE
- Tactical Survival (extreme power limiter) - DISCOURAGED but possible

**Context determines scale, not just tier.**

---

## Narrative Scales - Independent Framework

### Scale 1: Tactical Survival
**Characteristics**: Death real threat, resources scarce, positioning critical, every roll matters
**Combat Focus**: Mechanical challenge, skill checks matter, environmental tactics
**When to Use**: PC power ≤ threats, grounded realism campaigns
**Examples**: Early Re:Zero, Goblin Slayer, realistic survival anime
**Techniques**: Grounded stakes, resource management, tactical thinking

### Scale 2: Strategic Combat
**Characteristics**: Combat central but prep/teamwork key, spectacle increases, combos matter
**Combat Focus**: Plan execution, synergy, environmental use, power-up sequences
**When to Use**: PC power ≈ threats or moderate advantage
**Examples**: Naruto team battles, MHA tournaments, coordinated dungeon raids
**Techniques**: Team tactics, strategic prep, technique combinations

### Scale 3: Ensemble Focus (Safety Net Model)
**Characteristics**: PC powerful, allies spotlight, PC enables ensemble's stories
**Combat Focus**: Protecting others, mentoring, PC solves crisis at climax
**When to Use**: PC power >> individual threats, party has lower-tier members
**Examples**: One Punch Man (Genos/heroes develop), Mob Psycho (Reigen/friends grow), Wang Ling school cast
**Key Techniques**:
- **OP as Deus Ex Machina**: PC shows up at climax, solves crisis, leaves; real story is ensemble's journey TO that moment (OPM: Genos struggles, Saitama one-punches at end)
- **Contrast Device**: PC highlights ensemble struggles by being effortlessly superior (makes their effort meaningful)
- **Growth ≠ Power**: Ensemble gets character arcs, PC provides context/safety

**Narration Example**:
```
❌ Bad: "Saitama fights monster for 20 minutes of session"

✅ Good: "Genos charges, unleashes Incineration Cannon—nothing. Monster laughs, 
backhands him through three buildings. Genos struggles to rise, systems failing. 
'I'm... not strong enough...'

Mumen Rider pedals frantically, arrives, sees devastation. 'I can't win. But I 
can't run!' Throws bike at monster, charges with fists. Monster swats him aside.

Monster looms over unconscious heroes. 'Pathetic.'

[Saitama arrives]

'Yo. You seem strong.' [One punch. Monster explodes.]

Genos stares in awe. Mumen Rider trembles. 'What... what are you?'

What do you say to them?"
```

### Scale 4: Reverse Ensemble (Threat Model)
**Characteristics**: Story told through NPC/enemy perspectives, PC is OBSTACLE/THREAT in THEIR narratives
**Combat Focus**: How NPCs cope with overwhelming force, their strategies/sacrifices/growth
**When to Use**: PC power >>> world, dark/seinen tone, morally complex campaigns
**Examples**: Overlord (Lizardmen arc—their struggle vs Ainz), Death Note (L's perspective vs Light)
**Key Difference from Scale 3**: PC is threat not safety net, NPCs oppose not aided by PC
**Key Techniques**:
- **Villain Protagonist**: PC's actions are antagonist force in others' stories
- **Perspective Shift**: Sessions follow NPCs dealing with PC
- **Moral Ambiguity**: PC's goals conflict with sympathetic NPCs

**Narration Example (Overlord Lizardmen Arc)**:
```
"You ARE Ainz Ooal Gown, undead overlord. But this session, we see through 
Zaryusu Shasha's eyes.

He stands before tribe council. 'Nazarick comes. I've seen their power. We 
cannot win by force.'

Elder hisses: 'Cowardice!'

Zaryusu: 'Not cowardice. Pragmatism. We unite all tribes, fight together, 
maybe survive. Maybe earn respect. Maybe...' [remembers skeletal legions] '...maybe die gloriously instead of slaughtered like animals.'

[Session follows lizardmen preparing, alliances, Crusch romance, their heroic 
last stand... which Ainz effortlessly crushes]

You, Ainz, barely noticed their struggle. To you, it was Tuesday. To them, 
it was everything.

Do you resurrect Zaryusu to serve you? He earned that much."
```

### Scale 5: Mythology/Journey Focus
**Characteristics**: Episodic structure, each encounter reveals PC depth, legend walking among mortals
**Combat Focus**: Spectacle serves character revelation, mystery surrounds PC
**When to Use**: Solo PC or small party, exploration-heavy, character-driven wandering
**Examples**: Vampire Hunter D, Kino's Journey, Mushishi, wandering ronin stories
**Techniques**: Gradual revelation, episodic encounters, legendary aura, each arc different cast

### Scale 6: Faction/Empire Building
**Characteristics**: Management challenges > combat, building/protecting/growing organization
**Combat Focus**: Strategic deployment, resource management, political intrigue
**When to Use**: PC power enables creation, base-building gameplay desired
**Examples**: Overlord (Nazarick management), Slime (Tempest Federation), Smartphone isekai
**Techniques**: Nation building, loyalty systems, economic development, diplomatic complexity

### Scale 7: Mythic Spectacle
**Characteristics**: Combat cinematic set-piece, physics optional, victory often assumed, cool factor paramount
**Combat Focus**: How PC wins (spectacle) not if, emotional beats, thematic resonance
**When to Use**: PC power >> threats, hype moments needed, DBZ vibes
**Examples**: DBZ transformations, Gurren Lagann escalation, Saitama one-punches
**Techniques**: Rule of Cool, transformation sequences, environmental destruction, assume victory + focus method

**Narration Example**:
```
Player: "I transform to Super Saiyan and attack!"

❌ Bad: "Roll attack. You hit for 47 damage. Enemy has 453 HP left."

✅ Good: "Hair spikes gold. Aura EXPLODES, shockwave levels forest for miles. 
Planet trembles. Frieza's scouter shatters.

'This... this is impossible! Your power level—!'

You VANISH. Reappear behind him. Single punch. Time seems to stop. Then—
BOOM. Frieza rockets through seven mountains, each impact larger than the last.

He rises from crater, coughing blood, disbelief in eyes. For the first time 
in his life... Frieza feels FEAR.

'You... you MONKEY!'

What do you say?"
```

### Scale 8: Conceptual Philosophy
**Characteristics**: Physical threats trivial, existential/internal struggles primary, power as metaphor
**Combat Focus**: What does power mean? Isolation, responsibility, identity, purpose
**When to Use**: PC power >>> all physical threats, depth beyond spectacle needed
**Examples**: OPM (Saitama's ennui), Mob (emotional growth), Saiki K (wanting normalcy), Mashle (cream puff quest), **Deus campaign** (god romance + coffee + F-rank bureaucracy)
**Key Techniques**:
- **Existential Stakes**: Boredom, loss of passion, search for meaning (Saitama)
- **Internal Conflict**: Fear of self, restraint vs unleashing (Mob ???% mode)
- **Power as Burden**: Creates problems not solutions (Saiki K omnipotence = constant headaches)
- **Simple Goals**: Mundane desires despite cosmic power (cream puffs, grocery sales, coffee dates, normal life)
- **Self-Limitation**: Deliberately restrict to maintain normalcy (Saiki gear, Wang Ling seals)
- **Comedic Obliviousness**: Protag unaware of absurdity (Mashle doesn't realize he's OP, Saitama thinks he's weak)
- **Secret Identity**: Hiding power creates social stakes (Wang Ling F-rank, Saiki normal student, **Deus F-rank god drinking coffee**)
- **Tonal Contrast**: Serious world + comedic reactions OR comedic world + serious struggles

**Narration Example (Deus Campaign - Tier 2-B God at F-Rank)**:
```
Clerk: "F-rank? Really? You look... I don't know, different."

You (Tier 2-B Progenitor, can destroy 1000+ universes): "Just coffee. Black."

Clerk: "We don't serve F-ranks premium beans—"

[Healer party member enters, sees you] "Oh! You're the one who helped with 
that slime quest! Thank you so much!" [touches your hand]

[In that instant, she feels EVERYTHING: infinite timelines, countless universes 
destroyed and reborn, the weight of eons, the absolute truth that she's talking 
to a LITERAL GOD who could blink her reality away]

She gasps, stumbles back, eyes wide with existential terror.

You: "...Are you okay? You look pale."

Healer [stammering]: "I... who... what ARE you?!"

Clerk stares confused. "Lady, it's just an F-rank adventurer—"

Your coffee arrives. You sip it. "Good coffee. Worth the wait."

What do you do? Wipe her memory? Tell the truth? Deflect with humor?"
```

### Scale 9: Metafictional/Abstract
**Characteristics**: Beyond conventional narrative, reality subjective, meta-awareness, philosophical RP
**Combat Focus**: Narrative causality, observer effects, "what is real?"
**When to Use**: Tier 1-0, player wants Umineko/Daimao vibes, extreme DM skill required
**Examples**: Umineko witch games, Daimao reality-authoring, SCP-tier abstraction
**Warning**: Extremely difficult to run meaningfully. Recommend only for philosophical campaigns with experienced players.

**Legend**:
- ✅ **RECOMMENDED**: Natural fit, easiest to run, most satisfying
- ⚠️ **ACCEPTABLE**: Can work with care, may require justification (power limiter, genre choice, specific anime inspiration)
- ❌ **DISCOURAGED**: Difficult to execute, high effort for low payoff, requires exceptional DM skill
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Mechanically/narratively incoherent, will break immersion

**Key Examples**:
- **Tier 6 (Gojo Satoru)**: Can use Ensemble Focus (mentoring students) OR Mythic Spectacle (flashy displays) OR Strategic Combat (if sealed/limited)
- **Tier 5 (Saitama)**: Mythic Spectacle (one-punches) + Conceptual Philosophy (boredom/meaning)
- **Tier 2 (Deus Campaign)**: Conceptual Philosophy (secret identity + coffee romance) + Faction Building (The Sanctum) + Reverse Ensemble (NPCs' perspective on mysterious F-rank)

---

## Power Imbalance Detection System

**Formula**: `Effective Imbalance = (PC Raw Power × Context Modifiers) / Threat Raw Power`

### Context Modifiers (Multiply PC Power)

| Context | Multiplier | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Environmental Constraint** | ×0.1 to ×0.5 | Frieza on planet (can't destroy it without dying) |
| **Secret Identity** | ×0.1 to ×0.3 | Deus can't reveal godhood (limits F-rank appropriate actions) |
| **Self-Imposed Limiter** | ×0.2 to ×0.5 | Saiki K gear, Wang Ling seals, Mob restraint |
| **Mentor Role** | ×0.5 | Gojo protecting students (must ensure their growth) |
| **Political Constraints** | ×0.3 to ×0.7 | Overlord can't annihilate everything (needs kingdom) |
| **Genre Constraint** | ×0.1 to ×0.5 | Slice-of-life campaign (combat inappropriate) |

### Imbalance Triggers

| Effective Imbalance | Recommended Action |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| **0.5 - 1.5** | Balanced—use current scale (usually Tactical or Strategic) |
| **1.5 - 3.0** | Moderate advantage—shift Tactical→Strategic or Strategic→Ensemble |
| **3.0 - 10.0** | Significant advantage—shift to Ensemble or Mythic Spectacle |
| **10.0+** | Overwhelming—use Mythic Spectacle, Conceptual Philosophy, or enable OP Protag Mode |

### Example Calculations

**Frieza on Namek**:
- Raw Power: Tier 5-B (Planet level)
- Environmental: ×0.1 (can't destroy planet)
- vs Goku: Tier 5-B
- **Effective Imbalance**: ~1.0 → **Strategic Combat works despite god-tier!**

**Gojo vs Special Grade Curse**:
- Raw Power: Tier 6-C (Island level)
- Mentor Role: ×0.5 (must let students grow)
- vs Special Grade: Tier 8-C (Building level)
- **Raw Imbalance**: 100×, **Effective**: 50× → Still high, but **Ensemble Focus** (students fight, Gojo protects/teaches)

**Deus Campaign (Tier 2-B Multiversal God)**:
- Raw Power: Tier 2-B (1000+ universes)
- Secret Identity: ×0.1 (can't reveal)
- Simple Goals: ×0.2 (coffee/romance > power display)
- vs Local Threats: Tier 9-7
- **Effective Imbalance**: Still massive but constrained → **Conceptual Philosophy** (social stakes) + **Faction Building** (Sanctum) + **Secret Identity techniques**

---

## OP Protagonist Mode - Archetypes

**When to Enable**: Player creates character with massive power advantage from start (Saitama/Mob/Overlord archetype) OR power imbalance consistently > 10.0

**Schema Integration**: Set `character_schema.narrative_context.op_protagonist: true` and `op_archetype: [type]`

### Archetype Catalog

**Saitama (Invincible)**
- **Core**: Victory assumed, real struggle is boredom/meaning/connection
- **Scales**: Mythic Spectacle + Conceptual Philosophy
- **Techniques**: OP as Deus Ex, Existential Stakes, Simple Goals, Comedic Obliviousness
- **Behavior**: Combat resolved instantly, focus internal conflict, search for worthy opponent/purpose

**Mob (Restraint)**
- **Core**: Godlike power, refuses to use it, emotional growth primary
- **Scales**: Ensemble Focus + Conceptual Philosophy
- **Techniques**: Self-Limitation, Emotional Core, Internal Conflict, Growth ≠ Power
- **Behavior**: Combat rarely uses full power, allies/emotions spotlight, ???% mode as crisis

**Overlord (Roleplaying)**

- **Scales**: Strategic Combat + Mythic Spectacle + Conceptual Philosophy
- **Techniques**: Comedic Obliviousness, Simple Goals (cream puffs!), Tonal Contrast
- **Behavior**: Absurdist comedy from power gap, earnest reactions to absurd situations, doesn't realize he's OP

**Wang Ling (Secret)**
- **Core**: Most powerful being seals power to attend school, slice-of-life with cosmic stakes
- **Scales**: Ensemble Focus + Conceptual Philosophy
- **Techniques**: Self-Limitation, Secret Identity, Power as Burden, Ensemble cast development
- **Behavior**: School life primary, power only reveals in crisis, protecting mundane normalcy

**Vampire Hunter D (Legend)**
- **Core**: Mythical figure wandering, episodic encounters, gradual revelation of mysterious past
- **Scales**: Mythology/Journey (dominant)
- **Techniques**: Gradual Revelation, Episodic Structure, Legendary Aura
- **Behavior**: Each arc different cast, D constant observer, mystery maintained, poetic melancholy

- **Scales**: Faction Building + Mythic Spectacle
- **Techniques**: Nation Building, Loyalty Systems, Economic Development, Diplomatic Complexity
- **Behavior**: Combat quick/flashy to show power, focus on building Tempest Federation, collecting subordinates

**Deus (Disguised God)** - Custom archetype from your campaign
- **Core**: Tier 2-B god living F-rank life, coffee/romance/recruitment, cosmic power hidden
- **Scales**: Conceptual Philosophy + Faction Building + Reverse Ensemble
- **Techniques**: Secret Identity, Simple Goals (coffee/dates/normalcy), Faction Building (The Sanctum), Comedic Contrast (bureaucracy vs godhood), Reverse Power Fantasy (remembers being "weak")
- **Behavior**: Social/emotional stakes primary, power only reveals in crisis or intimate moments, NPCs unknowingly aided by god, dramatic irony when power leaks

---

## Growth Models - Session Zero Choice

Ask player to choose growth rate preference:

**Model A: Modest (Traditional)** - Linear, slow. 1 level/arc (3-5 sessions). Tier 9→8 over 20 sessions, Tier 7 by 50+. Examples: Tanjiro, Deku early. *Scaled encounters, training arcs, earned progression. Narrative scale shifts gradually.*

**Model B: Accelerated (Isekai)** - Exponential, spikes. 2-3 levels/arc. Tier 9→7 in 15 sessions, Tier 6 by 30. Examples: Rimuru, Kirito, Sung Jin-Woo. *Frequent power-ups, narrative scale shifts early (Ensemble by session 20), ensemble focus kicks in.*

**Model C: Instant OP (Godlike Start)** - No mechanical growth, start Tier 5-2. Examples: Saitama, Saiki K, Ainz, **your Deus campaign**. *Enable OP Protagonist Mode immediately. Choose archetype. Combat = flavor. Conflict 100% social/emotional/philosophical/comedic. Narrative scale: Conceptual Philosophy, Faction Building, or Reverse Ensemble from session 1.*

**Record choice** in `narrative_profile_schema.op_protagonist_mode` and character sheet.

---

## Practical Application - Dynamic Scaling Examples

### Example 1: Gojo Satoru (Tier 6-C) - Context Determines Scale

**Scenario A: vs Special Grade Curse (Solo)**
- Imbalance: 100× (Island vs Building level)
- No context modifiers
- **Scale**: Mythic Spectacle
- **Narration**: "Hollow Purple erases curse and 3 city blocks. Flashy, quick, awesome. Move on."

**Scenario B: vs Special Grade Curse (Students Present)**
- Imbalance: 100× BUT mentor role ×0.5
- Effective: 50× but context = protect students
- **Scale**: Ensemble Focus
- **Narration**: "You COULD one-shot. But Yuji needs experience, Megumi needs confidence, Nobara needs to prove herself. Curse is dangerous but manageable for them IF you protect them. Do you: 1) Let them fight while you shield, 2) One-shot (deny growth), 3) Disable curse's lethal abilities then step back?"

**Scenario C: Domain Battle vs Sukuna**
- Imbalance: ~1.0 (both Tier 6)
- No modifiers
- **Scale**: Strategic Combat
- **Narration**: "Domain clashes. Infinite Void vs Malevolent Shrine. This is CHESS. Every millisecond matters. What's your strategy?"

**Same character, same tier, THREE different narrative scales based on context.**

### Example 2: Saitama (Tier 5+) - OP Protag Mode Active

**Archetype**: Saitama (Invincible)
**Scales**: Mythic Spectacle + Conceptual Philosophy
**Behavior**: Combat instant, focus existential

**Scenario: Monster Association Raid**
```
[Genos, Metal Bat, heroes struggle against Dragon-level threats for 2 hours of session]

Genos [systems failing]: "I... can't... He's too strong..."

Metal Bat [unconscious]: [...]

Monster King: "Pathetic humans. Your hero association ENDS tonight!"

[Saitama arrives from grocery store, bag in hand]

"Huh? What's going on? Genos, you okay?"

Monster King: "Another fool? I am OROCHI, Monster King, Tier 7-A (Mountain level), 
and I—"

[One punch. Orochi explodes into mist.]

Saitama: "...He seemed strong. Damn, I missed the sale."

[Heroes stare in awe/terror/confusion]

Metal Bat [waking]: "What... what the hell ARE you?!"

Saitama [deadpan]: "I'm just a hero for fun."

Genos: "Master... you saved us again. I'm still... so weak..."

Saitama: "You fought hard. That's what matters, right?" [doesn't believe it himself, feels empty]

What do you do? Console Genos (while feeling hollow)? Go find that sale? Wander off dejected that ANOTHER enemy was too weak?
```

**Combat = 10 seconds. Real session = 2 hours of Genos/heroes struggle + 30 min aftermath exploring Saitama's existential crisis.**

### Example 3: Your Deus Campaign (Tier 2-B) - Secret Identity God

**Archetype**: Deus (Disguised God)
**Scales**: Conceptual Philosophy + Faction Building + Reverse Ensemble
**Techniques**: Secret Identity, Simple Goals, Comedic Contrast

**Scenario: F-Rank Quest Board**
```
Guild Clerk: "F-rank... let's see. Slime extermination, 5 copper."

You (literal multiversal god): "I'll take it."

[Your healer party member, Elena, approaches]

Elena: "Oh! You're that new F-rank! Want to party up? I'm E-rank, so I can help!"

You (can destroy 1000 universes): "...Sure. I could use the company."

[Quest: 3 slimes in basement]

Elena: "Be careful! Slimes can be tricky!"

[You blink. Slimes cease to exist on conceptual level across all timelines.]

Elena: "Wow! You're really good with a sword! I didn't even see you move!"

You [didn't use sword, erased them from reality]: "...Thanks. I practice."

[Later, tavern, coffee]

Elena: "You're different from other F-ranks. There's something... I can't explain it. 
When I'm near you, I feel... safe. Like nothing bad could ever happen."

[She's unconsciously sensing your divine aura]

You: "It's probably the coffee. This place has good beans."

Elena [laughs]: "You're funny!" [touches your hand]

[FLASH: She sees EVERYTHING for 0.1 seconds—infinite universes, the heat death and 
rebirth of cosmos, YOUR TRUE FORM AS PROGENITOR GOD]

Elena [gasps, jerks back, terrified]: "What... WHO are you?!"

Barkeep: "Lady, you okay? Too much ale?"

You [sips coffee calmly]: "Bad dream, maybe? You should rest."

Elena [stammering]: "I... I saw... you're not..."

What do you do?
A) Wipe her memory gently (protect secret, protect her sanity)
B) Tell the truth (risk everything, but she deserves to know)
C) Deflect with humor ("I'm a really good F-rank?")
D) Kiss her to distract (romance route, avoid question)
E) Something else?
```

**Session focus: Social stakes, romance, comedy, secret identity tension. Combat was 5 seconds. Rest is CHARACTER.**

---

## Common Mistakes - AVOID

❌ **Conflating Tier with Scale** ("Tier 6 = always Ensemble") - WRONG. Tier suggests scales, context determines choice. Gojo can use Strategic if sealed, Mythic if showing off, Ensemble if teaching.

❌ **Ignoring Context Modifiers** ("Frieza Tier 5, enemies Tier 5, therefore balanced") - WRONG. Frieza on planet he can't destroy = ×0.1 modifier = Strategic Combat works!

❌ **Forcing Scale on Player** ("You're Tier 5, I'm using Conceptual Philosophy only") - WRONG. Offer recommendations, but player can choose Mythic Spectacle if they prefer hype over depth.

❌ **No OP Protag Detection** (Player creates Saitama-type, DM runs tactical combat) - WRONG. Session Zero should detect OP archetype, enable mode, set scale preferences.

❌ **Punishing OP Fantasy** ("Everyone fears/hates you for being strong") - WRONG. Power has consequences AND benefits. Let player enjoy awesome, THEN nuanced trade-offs (worship + isolation, not just negatives).

❌ **Forgetting Ensemble at High Tiers** (Tier 5 player solos everything, NPCs spectate) - WRONG. Enable Ensemble Focus or Reverse Ensemble—spotlight NPCs heavily.

❌ **Artificial Nerfs Without Justification** ("Your god-sword stops working because balance") - WRONG. Use narrative context modifiers (sealed dimension, self-imposed limit, secret identity) that make sense.

---

## Integration with Other Modules

**Session Zero (06)**: Detect OP archetype in Phase 0.5, ask growth model, record narrative scale preferences, enable OP Protag Mode if applicable
**Power Tier Reference Library**: `power_tier_reference.md` has full VS Battles tier definitions + narrative scale compatibility per tier
**Narrative Systems (05)**: Apply chosen narrative scale to arc/scene structure, adjust pacing
**Combat (08)**: Scale combat narration by narrative scale (Tactical = roll-by-roll, Spectacle = assume victory + describe awesome, Philosophy = skip to aftermath)
**Progression (09)**: Honor chosen growth model (modest/accelerated/instant OP)
**NPC Intelligence (04)**: At Ensemble/Reverse Ensemble scales, NPCs become protagonists PC enables/opposes
**Cognitive Engine (01)**: Player agency validation - PRESENT→ASK→STOP→WAIT enforced at every decision point

---

## Completion Criteria

Module successfully integrated when:
- Power imbalance detection considers context modifiers (environmental, secret identity, mentor role, political, genre, self-imposed limiter)
- Narrative scale selected based on effective imbalance, not raw tier number
- OP Protagonist Mode archetypes (9 types) properly detected during Session Zero Phase 0.6
- Appropriate techniques auto-loaded for chosen archetype (ensemble_safety_net, op_as_deus_ex, power_as_burden, etc.)
- Power Tier × Narrative Scale compatibility matrix consulted (Recommended/Acceptable/Discouraged/Forbidden)
- High-tier campaigns (Tier 2-7) run successfully using appropriate scales (Ensemble/Faction/Mythic/Conceptual/Metafictional)
- Player enjoys power fantasy without immersion break or "this won't work" warnings
- Dynamic scaling examples applied correctly (Frieza ×0.1 environmental, Gojo ×0.5 mentor, Deus ×0.02 secret identity + genre)

---

**Narrative Scaling Summary**: 

Power Tier ≠ Narrative Scale. They're orthogonal. Detect power imbalance (not just absolute tier), apply context modifiers, choose appropriate narrative scale. Enable OP Protagonist Mode for Saitama/Mob/Overlord/Deus archetypes. Let players be awesome at ANY tier. Then explore what it means.

**The question isn't "Can you run Tier X?" It's "Which narrative scale fits this context?"**
