# AIDM v2 Development Roadmap

## Version 2.0 - MVP (Current)

See `docs/SCOPE.md` for complete feature list and acceptance tests.

**Status**: Production ready - core system complete, index files optimized (October 2025)

**Recent Completion**: Index optimization (October 13, 2025) - 62.3% token reduction for Session Zero efficiency, DEEP_RESEARCH_PROMPT.md added for external AI analysis.

## Future Phases (Post-MVP)

### Phase 2: Expansion
- Constitutional AI ethical framework
- Advanced emotional intelligence (multi-dimensional emotion tracking)
- Multimodal scene generation (images, music)
- Expanded genre libraries (10+ anime genres)
- Community-shared world templates

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Tree-structured narrative planning (MCTS)
- Curiosity-driven exploration mechanics
- Federated learning across sessions
- Cross-platform state sync
- Collaborative multi-player framework

### Phase 4: Experimental
- VR/AR integration
- Advanced NPC autonomy (NPCs pursue independent goals)
- Procedural world generation
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment
- Emergent quest generation

## Scope Change Protocol

Proposed features must:
1. Align with core philosophy (player agency, emergent storytelling, anime integration)
2. Stay within LLM instruction-set paradigm (no external dependencies)
3. Pass cost-benefit analysis (value > complexity)
4. Not break existing tests (8 acceptance tests)
5. Have clear success criteria (testable, measurable)

**Approval required**: New core systems, architecture changes, external dependencies, removing limitations  
**No approval needed**: New libraries, templates, documentation, bug fixes

## Version 2.0 Scope Freeze

**As of October 2025, v2.0 scope is FROZEN.** No new features beyond those documented in SCOPE.md. All future enhancements go into v2.1+ planning.

This ensures:
- MVP ships complete and tested
- No feature creep delays launch
- Clear boundary for "done enough"
- Foundation for future iteration

**When proposing features**: Ask "Is this essential for core anime RPG experience, or nice-to-have for future versions?"
