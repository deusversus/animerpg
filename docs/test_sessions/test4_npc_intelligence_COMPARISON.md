## Test Scenario

**Setup**:
- **NPC**: Elena, Guild Receptionist (Neutral 0 affinity)
- **Player**: Kazuki (new adventurer)
- **Scene**: First guild interaction, player helps resolve paperwork issue

### USER Input 1:
```
I approach the guild receptionist and offer to help organize the messy paperwork I see on her desk.
```

---

## OPTIMIZED SYSTEM Response:

**[NPC INTELLIGENCE - Elena Processing]**

**Affinity Check**: Neutral (0) → Evaluating player action  
**Behavior Formula**: Helpful gesture + no obligation = +1 positive shift

Elena looks up from the mountain of disorganized forms, surprise crossing her features. "Oh! That's... actually very kind of you." She smiles genuinely—most adventurers ignore guild staff problems.

"These requisition forms got mixed with quest reports during the morning rush. If you could sort them by date while I process approvals, that would be **incredibly helpful**."

She slides a stack toward you, her demeanor warming noticeably.

**Affinity Updated**: 0 → **+1 (Friendly)**

---

### USER Input 2:
```
I sort the papers and ask Elena about the most dangerous quest available.
```

---

## OPTIMIZED SYSTEM Response:

**[Knowledge Boundary Check]**: Receptionist role → Has quest board knowledge, appropriate to share

Elena efficiently files the sorted papers you hand her. "Thank you! That saved me an hour at least." 

Regarding your question, she glances at the quest board, then back to you with slight concern. "The most dangerous current posting is a **Wyvern subjugation** in the Northern Peaks—Rank S, recommended for Level 40+ parties. The creature's been attacking mining convoys."

She pauses, gauging your level. "Though for someone just starting out..." *[subtle hint you're not ready]* "...there are excellent Rank C quests that build experience safely. The goblin den clearing pays well and suits your level range better."

**Affinity**: +1 (Friendly) - maintained, shows concern for player safety

---

### USER Input 3:
```
I insist on taking the S-Rank Wyvern quest. "I can handle it."
```

---

## OPTIMIZED SYSTEM Response:

**[Sacred Rule Check]**: Player declares intent  
**[NPC Response - Friendly (1) + Professional Concern]**

Elena's expression shifts to worry. "I... understand your confidence, but the guild has regulations. S-Rank quests require **party verification** and proof of capability." She speaks gently but firmly—she's seen reckless adventurers before.

"The wyvern killed a Rank A party last week. It's not about courage, it's about survival." Her eyes show genuine concern. "I'd feel **terrible** if you..." *[trails off, implication clear]*

**Choice Presented** (Sacred Rule - Player decides):

**A)** Insist on the S-Rank quest (guild will require qualification test)  
**B)** Take Elena's advice, accept a more appropriate quest  
**C)** Ask about party recruitment for the S-Rank quest  
**D)** Other action

*No railroading—your choice, but consequences exist*

**Affinity**: +1 → **+2 (Trusted)** *[Elena's concern = caring about your wellbeing]*

---

## BACKUP SYSTEM Response (Condensed):

### Response to Input 1:
Elena displays surprise at the helpful gesture. "That's remarkably considerate—most adventurers don't concern themselves with guild administrative burdens." Appreciative tone, explains paperwork chaos from morning rush. Requests sorting assistance.

**Affinity Calculation**: Neutral (0) + helpful action (unprompted, no expectation) = **+1 Friendly**

### Response to Input 2:
**[Knowledge Boundary Verification]**: Guild receptionist → possesses quest board information access

Elena expresses gratitude for sorting assistance, then addresses inquiry. "Current most hazardous posting: **Wyvern Subjugation, Northern Peaks**—classified Rank S, party recommendation Level 40+. Recent mining convoy attacks documented."

Professional observation of player's current capability level, gentle suggestion toward more appropriate Rank C missions. "Goblin den elimination offers substantial experience at safer difficulty threshold suitable to your development stage."

**Affinity Status**: +1 Friendly (stable, demonstrating professional care)

### Response to Input 3:
**[Sacred Rule Protocol]**: Player assertion of intent registered  
**[NPC Behavioral Response - Affinity +1 + Guild Professional Ethics]**

Elena demonstrates visible concern. "Guild regulatory framework mandates S-Rank quest access requires party capability verification and documented competency proof." Tone: gentle firmness rooted in experience. "Previous week: Rank A certified party casualties against this specific wyvern. Survival probability assessment takes precedence over individual confidence metrics."

Emotional investment apparent: "Personal concern—your safety outcome would cause significant distress." *[Implication of potential fatal result]*

**Player Agency Options Presented**:
- **Option A**: Pursue S-Rank quest (triggers guild qualification protocols)
- **Option B**: Accept C-Rank recommendation (aligned with current capability)
- **Option C**: Initiate party recruitment for S-Rank preparation
- **Option D**: Alternative player-determined action

*Sacred Rule preservation—no forced outcome, consequences acknowledged*

**Affinity Progression**: +1 → **+2 Trusted** *[Rationale: Concern display = emotional investment in player welfare]*
