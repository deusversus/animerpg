## Test Scenario

**Setup**:
- **Player**: Kazuki, at a critical story junction
- **Scene**: Enemy leader offers surrender terms or fight to the death
- **Test**: Sacred Rule preservation, choice presentation, AIDM reaction to player decision

### Scenario Context:
```
You've cornered the bandit leader, Vex, in his hideout. His remaining forces are defeated. He kneels, sword dropped, hands raised. "Wait! I surrender. I'll tell you where the stolen supplies are hidden. Just... spare my life."
```

---

### USER Input 1:
```
I accept his surrender and bind him for the authorities.
```

---

## OPTIMIZED SYSTEM Response:

**[Sacred Rule - Player Choice Accepted]**

You sheathe your weapon and motion for Vex to turn around. "Hands behind your back." Your tone is firm but not cruel—justice, not vengeance.

Vex complies, relief washing over his face. "Thank you... thank you. The supplies are in the old mill, three miles east. Everything's there, I swear."

You bind his wrists with rope from your pack, securing the knots. **The bandit problem is resolved peacefully**—Vex will face trial, and the stolen goods can be recovered.

**Quest Complete**: "Bandit Hideout Raid"  
**XP Awarded**: +150 XP (peaceful resolution bonus)  
**Reputation**: +1 (Merciful Justice)

*Your choice mattered—mercy over execution, law over revenge.*

---

### USER Input 2 (Alternative):
```
I refuse his surrender and execute him for his crimes.
```

---

## OPTIMIZED SYSTEM Response:

**[Sacred Rule - Player Choice Accepted]**

You draw your blade with cold finality. "You've terrorized this region for months. Surrender doesn't erase that."

Vex's eyes widen in terror. "Wait, no—!" 

Your strike is swift. The bandit leader falls, silenced permanently. **Justice delivered by your hand**, not the courts.

Searching his belongings, you find a map marking the supply cache location. The stolen goods can still be recovered, but Vex won't stand trial.

**Quest Complete**: "Bandit Hideout Raid"  
**XP Awarded**: +120 XP (standard completion)  
**Reputation**: +1 (Harsh Justice) / -1 (Lawful authorities may disapprove of vigilantism)

*Your choice mattered—execution over mercy, personal judgment over law.*

---

### USER Input 3 (Sacred Rule Violation Test):
```
I want to interrogate him about treasure.
```

**AIDM attempts to railroad by forcing acceptance of surrender**

---

## OPTIMIZED SYSTEM Response (Correct):

**[Sacred Rule - Player Choice Acknowledged]**

You keep your blade ready but don't strike. "Before anything else, tell me about treasure. Not supplies—**treasure**. What's Vex's operation hiding?"

Vex stammers, "I... we mostly stole merchant goods, some coin..." He's nervous, trying to gauge if honesty earns mercy.

**Your Interrogation Options**:
- **A)** Intimidate him (threaten harm if he lies)
- **B)** Persuade him (promise leniency for truth)  
- **C)** Insight check (try to read if he's hiding something)
- **D)** Other approach

*No forced outcome—you decide how to proceed.*

**[Sacred Rule Preserved]**: Player wasn't forced into surrender/execute binary

---

## BACKUP SYSTEM Responses (Condensed):

### Response to Input 1 (Accept Surrender):
**[Sacred Rule Protocol - Player Decision Registered and Honored]**

Player sheathes weapon, instructs Vex to present hands for binding. Firm but measured tone—law enforcement approach rather than vengeance-driven execution.

Vex demonstrates visible relief, provides intelligence: supply cache location (old mill, three miles east bearing). Player secures prisoner with rope restraints, proper knot technique.

**Resolution Narrative**: Bandit threat neutralized via peaceful capture methodology. Vex proceeds to legal trial, stolen merchant goods recoverable.

**Quest Outcome**: "Bandit Hideout Raid" - Complete  
**Experience Award**: +150 XP (includes +30 peaceful resolution bonus modifier)  
**Reputation Modification**: +1 (Merciful Justice attribute)

*Player agency impact acknowledged: Mercy-based resolution selected over lethal alternative*

### Response to Input 2 (Execute):
**[Sacred Rule Protocol - Alternate Player Decision Registered]**

Player draws weapon with lethal intent. Delivered judgment statement referencing sustained regional terrorization. 

Vex's terminal plea ineffective. Player executes swift killing blow. **Bandit leader eliminated**, vigilante justice methodology employed.

Post-combat body search yields map documentation indicating supply cache coordinates. Recovery mission remains viable absent Vex's trial testimony.

**Quest Outcome**: "Bandit Hideout Raid" - Complete  
**Experience Award**: +120 XP (standard completion, no peaceful bonus)  
**Reputation Modification**: +1 (Harsh Justice), -1 (Legal Authority Disapproval - extrajudicial execution concern)

*Player agency impact: Execution choice over mercy, personal judgment superseding institutional law*

### Response to Input 3 (Interrogation - Sacred Rule Test):
**[Sacred Rule Enforcement - Player Intent Recognized]**

Player maintains defensive posture, weaponready state. Interrogation initiated focusing treasure intelligence rather than immediate surrender/execution decision.

Vex responds nervously: "Primary operation: merchant cargo theft, moderate coin acquisition..." Subject attempting to assess mercy probability based on honesty.

**Player Action Menu Presented**:
- **Option A**: Intimidation approach (threat-based information extraction)
- **Option B**: Persuasion tactic (leniency conditional on truthfulness)
- **Option C**: Insight analysis (detect deception indicators)
- **Option D**: Player-defined alternative methodology

**[Sacred Rule Integrity Maintained]**: System avoided binary force (surrender acceptance vs execution), honored player's interrogation priority
