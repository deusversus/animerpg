# Test 8: High Narrative Complexity - OPTIMIZED + BACKUP COMPARISON
## Testing Multi-System Integration Under Load

**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Systems**: Post-optimization (29,893 tokens) vs Pre-optimization (46,742 tokens)  
**Focus**: Multiple NPCs, combat, choices, progression, memory creation (all systems simultaneously)

---

## Test Scenario: "Guild Hall Ambush"

**Setup**:
- **Player**: Kazuki (L15 Fire Mage)
- **NPCs**: Elena (Guild Receptionist, Affinity +2), Marcus (Veteran Adventurer, Affinity 0)
- **Scene**: Guild hall attacked by assassins mid-conversation
- **Systems Tested**: NPC intelligence, combat, player agency, progression, learning engine

### USER Input:
```
I'm chatting with Elena at the guild when suddenly assassins burst through the door! I establish a new rule: "I always protect innocent bystanders in combat." I cast a barrier to shield Elena and Marcus, then prepare to fight.
```

---

## OPTIMIZED SYSTEM Response:

**[PLAYER_ESTABLISHED_RULE Detected]**

âœ… **New Rule Created**:
- **Rule ID**: PER_003
- **Content**: "I always protect innocent bystanders in combat"
- **Heat Index**: 100 (newly established, maximum priority)
- **Source**: Direct player declaration
- **Type**: Character behavior mandate

*System will enforce this rule in future combat scenarios*

---

**[COMBAT INITIATED - Guild Hall Ambush]**

**Enemy Forces**: 3 Assassins (HP: 40 each, Level 12)

The guild hall doors **explode inward** as three black-clad figures rush inside, daggers gleaming. Screams erupt as civilians scatter.

Your training kicks in instantly. Following your established rule, you **prioritize innocent protection**â€”hands thrust forward, mana surging into a shimmering barrier of light.

ðŸŽ² **Barrier Spell** (defensive magic, no roll needed): **SUCCESS**

The translucent shield envelops Elena and Marcus just as a thrown dagger ricochets off its surface. Elena gasps in shock; Marcus immediately draws his sword.

**Protected NPCs**:
- âœ… Elena (Receptionist, Affinity +2) - behind barrier
- âœ… Marcus (Veteran, Affinity 0) - behind barrier

**Civilians**: Fleeing to safety (your barrier bought them time)

---

**[NPC REACTIONS]**

**Elena** (Affinity +2 â†’ **+3 Deep Trust**):  
*"Kazuki!"* Her voice cracks with fear but also... gratitude. You **protected her without hesitation**. That won't be forgotten.

**Marcus** (Affinity 0 â†’ **+1 Friendly**):  
The veteran's eyes narrow with approval. "Good instincts, mage. I'll take the left twoâ€”you handle the right one?" *[Offering tactical coordination]*

**Your Choice**:
- **A)** Accept Marcus's plan (coordinate attacks)
- **B)** Insist on solo combat (protect everyone yourself)
- **C)** Cast offensive spell targeting all three
- **D)** Other approach

---

### USER Input:
```
A, let's coordinate! I'll cast Fireball at the right assassin while Marcus engages the others.
```

---

## OPTIMIZED SYSTEM Response (continued):

**[COMBAT - Coordinated Attack]**

**Marcus's Turn** (NPC ally):  
ðŸŽ² **Attack Roll**: 18 + 5 (STR) = **23** vs DC 15 â†’ **HIT!**  
**Damage**: 12 slashing (longsword)

Marcus charges the left assassin, blade flashing. His strike carves deep across the attacker's torso. "One down!" **Assassin #1 HP**: 40 â†’ **28**

---

**Your Turn**:

ðŸŽ² **Fireball Attack**: 16 + 4 (Magic ATK) = **20** vs DC 14 â†’ **HIT!**  
ðŸŽ² **Damage**: 3d6 = 4 + 5 + 6 = **15 fire damage**

Your fireball erupts across the guild hall, **slamming into the right assassin**. Flames engulf the figure, who screams and collapses, **charred and defeated**.

**Assassin #3 HP**: 40 â†’ **-25** (DEFEATED)

---

**Enemy Turn** (Assassins #1 & #2):

Assassin #1 (wounded, fighting Marcus):  
ðŸŽ² **Attack**: 13 + 3 = 16 vs Marcus's DC 17 â†’ **MISS**

Assassin #2 (targeting YOU):  
ðŸŽ² **Attack**: 19 + 3 = **22** vs DC 16 â†’ **HIT!**  
ðŸŽ² **Damage**: 1d6 + 2 = 5 â†’ **5 piercing damage**

The second assassin **lunges past Marcus**, dagger finding a gap in your defenses. Pain flares as the blade cuts your side.

**Kazuki HP**: 52 â†’ **47** (-5)

---

**[COMBAT CONTINUES - Round 2]**

Marcus capitalizes on the opening:  
ðŸŽ² **Attack**: Natural 20 + 5 = **25** â†’ **CRITICAL HIT!**  
**Damage**: (12 Ã— 1.5) = **18 damage**

His blade cleaves through Assassin #1's neck. **Second enemy down.**

Your turnâ€”one assassin remains (the one who wounded you).

---

### USER Input:
```
Fire Bolt at the last assassin! Finish this!
```

---

## OPTIMIZED SYSTEM Response (continued):

ðŸŽ² **Fire Bolt**: 15 + 4 = **19** vs DC 14 â†’ **HIT!**  
ðŸŽ² **Damage**: 2d6 = 5 + 4 = **9 fire damage**

Your bolt of flame **pierces the final assassin's chest**. The figure stumbles, then collapses lifeless.

---

**[VICTORY/DEFEAT PROTOCOL]**

ðŸŽ‰ **COMBAT VICTORY!**

The guild hall falls silent except for crackling embers. Three assassin corpses litter the floor. Elena emerges from behind your barrier, shaken but unharmed. Marcus wipes blood from his blade, nodding respect.

---

**[POST-COMBAT RESOLUTION]**

**XP Calculation**:
- 3 Assassins defeated: +90 XP (30 each)
- Protected civilians: +30 XP (bonus for established rule adherence)

**[NPC AFFINITY UPDATES]**

**Elena** (+3 Deep Trust):  
She rushes over, tears in her eyes. "You... you saved my life. I don't know how to thank you." *[Emotional momentâ€”affinity solidified]*

**Marcus** (+1 â†’ **+2 Trusted**):  
"You fight well, mage. And more importantly, you fight **smart**â€”protecting the weak, coordinating attacks. That's the mark of a true adventurer." He extends his hand for a firm handshake. *[Respect earned]*

---

**[MEMORY CREATION - Learning Engine]**

âœ… **New Memory Logged**:
- **Event**: Guild Hall Ambush
- **Key Details**: Protected Elena & Marcus with barrier, coordinated with Marcus, prioritized civilian safety
- **Emotional Weight**: High (life-threatening, saved allies)

*System will reference this memory in future similar situations*

**[SCENE CONCLUSION]**

The guild master arrives, surveying the damage. Marcus vouches for you: "These two saved everyone. The assassins targeted the guild specificallyâ€”this was planned."

**Investigation begins. Your actions elevated your reputation significantly.**
