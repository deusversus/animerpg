## Critical Path

## Critical Path

**Testing Status**: SHELVED (deferred to post-Phase 2.1)
- 2/8 passed (TEST-001 Session Zero ✅, TEST-004 Player Agency ✅)
- 6/8 remaining tests deferred until after core systems development

**Current Focus**: Phase 2.1 Core Systems Development
1. Phase 2.1a: Architectural fixes (schema migration, automated cascades)
2. Phase 2.1b: Quest Management System
3. Phase 2.1c: Faction/Reputation System
4. Phase 2.1d: Economy System
5. Phase 2.1e: Combat Enhancements

## System Metrics

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Token Budget** | ~89.5k base | ✅ 44.75% of 200k |
| **Active Load** | ~20-30k | ✅ Tier 1 + selective Tier 2 |
| **Module Optimization** | 62.3% reduction | ✅ 142k → 54k modules |
| **Schema Optimization** | 31.1% reduction | ✅ New schemas: 6.5k → 4.5k |
| **Test Coverage** | 2/8 complete | ⚠️ Testing shelved (deferred) |
| **Long-term Validation** | Untested | ⚠️ 10+ session campaigns needed |

---

## Known Issues

**Validation Gaps**:
- Multi-anime fusion (3+ anime) untested
- Long-term memory (1000+ exchanges) untested
- Extreme scale (100+ NPCs/quests) theoretical

**Missing Features**:
- ✅ Death/resurrection rules implemented (0 HP = Downed, death saves, resurrection costs)
- ✅ Combat maneuvers implemented (grapple, disarm, called shot, aid)
- ✅ Training system implemented (downtime training, skill XP, montage mechanics)
- ✅ Tournament framework implemented (bracket management, fatigue, seeding, spectators)

**Completed (Phase 2.1a)**:
- ✅ Quest management system -> `quest_schema.json` created with full branching/dependencies
- ✅ Faction reputation mechanics -> `faction_schema.json` created with tier system
- ✅ Automated cascade system -> Implemented in Module 03 (NPC death, location destruction, quest completion, faction power shift)
- ✅ Documentation consistency fixes (Module 10, prompt injection defense, terminology alignment)
