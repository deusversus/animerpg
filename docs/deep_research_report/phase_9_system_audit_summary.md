AIDM v2 System-Level Audit Summary

Strengths and Weaknesses Across Key Areas

Instruction Architecture

Strengths: AIDM v2 follows a highly modular instruction-set architecture, with 13 independent modules

that   each   handle   specific   GM   functions   (e.g.   cognitive   engine,   state   management,   combat,   narrative

calibration)

1

. The October 2025 optimization campaign eliminated nearly all verbose “fluff,” resulting in

instruction files that are  concise and structured (using tables, bullet points, and minimal examples)
Core   control   instructions   (e.g.   CORE_AIDM_INSTRUCTIONS.md )   have   virtually   no   redundancy

3

2

.

,   and

design principles like “State as Truth” and “Fail Gracefully” ensure each module communicates via shared

data and can degrade safely if something is missing

4

. This yields a clear, maintainable system prompt

architecture that is easy to update or extend.

Weaknesses: The sheer number of modules and cross-references introduces complexity. Early audits found

overlap   in   responsibilities  –   for   example,   the  Player   Agency  module   (12)   and  Narrative   Calibration

module (13) both tried to handle “overpowered protagonist” logic in isolation, leading to redundant rules

5

. Such duplication confused the system (two separate OP-protagonist systems with no coordination).

This was addressed by later integration work, but it highlights how a modular approach can create silos if

not carefully integrated. Additionally, setting up AIDM requires loading many files in order; without the
provided loader script, a user might find it cumbersome (though the  AIDM_LOADER.md  mitigates this with

a   one-copy   setup   process

6

).   Overall,   the   instruction   architecture   is   strong,   but   it   demanded   careful

auditing   to   eliminate   verbosity   and   ensure   all   modules   remain  in   sync  rather   than   working   at   cross-

purposes.

Narrative Profile & Genre Integration

Strengths: The system’s narrative content depth is exceptional – AIDM includes 12K-word highly detailed

anime narrative profiles and comprehensive genre trope libraries covering common patterns

7

8

. This

provides rich storytelling “DNA” for the AI to emulate varied anime genres with authenticity. Each narrative

profile   defines   unique   storytelling   scales   (pacing,   tone,   absurdity,   etc.)   and   trope   usage,   and   the   trope

libraries themselves (Shonen, Isekai, Seinen, Slice-of-Life) contain extensive templates (e.g. training arcs,

tournament   structures,   isekai   variations)

8

.   In   theory,   this   gives   AIDM   a   powerful   toolkit   to   produce

narratively   faithful   scenes   in   many   styles.   The  Genre   Tropes  and  Power   Systems  libraries   are   very

information-dense and cover most anime conventions

9

, which is a major strength for narrative fidelity.

Weaknesses: Prior to recent fixes, narrative-first design was isolating mechanical systems, meaning the

rich   story   profiles   did  not   inform   gameplay   mechanics.   An   integration   audit   found   that   Module   13

(Narrative   Calibration)   produced   great   storytelling   tone   but  “orphaned”   the   combat,   power,   and

progression   systems

7

.   For   example,   profiles   would   describe   a   world’s   tone   or   pacing   but  never

mention how to handle HP/MP, stat use, or XP for that genre

10

. Similarly, the genre trope libraries

existed but were not actually linked to the profiles – AIDM might load an anime’s profile and be unaware

1

that   a   generic   trope   (like   a   tournament   arc   template)   was   available   in   another   file

11

.   This   systemic

weakness meant the AI could tell a story in the right style, but lacked guidance to apply the right game

mechanics or structural tropes, undermining gameplay coherence. The team has since implemented a

scaffolding solution (discussed below) adding cross-references and “mechanical implementation” sections

to profiles, but some gaps remain. Not all trope libraries are fully complete or referenced (e.g. profiles

initially had 0 mentions of trope files

11

), and some planned genre libraries were  still missing entirely

(e.g.   no   shoujo,   mecha,   sports   tropes   yet)

12

.   In   summary,   narrative   content   quality   is   very   high,   but

integration with mechanics and full genre coverage required significant retrofitting.

Combat and Progression Balance

Strengths: AIDM’s combat and progression systems are well-defined and flexible. The Combat Resolution

module supports both tactical, turn-based fights and narrated “spectacle” outcomes, with explicit resource

tracking (HP/MP/SP) and dice-based damage calculation

13

. It implements initiative order, skill costs, boss

phases, and ensures combat results feed into narrative consequences (per testing criteria, combat shouldn’t

. The  Progression Systems  module provides
be pure dice math – narrative context is maintained)
multiple leveling curves and XP award models, from slow milestone-based growth to fast XP per session, to

15

14

accommodate   different   anime   pacing

16

.   Notably,  Player   Agency’s   “Power   Level”   settings  give   three

growth model options (Modest, Accelerated, Instant OP) that determine how quickly a character becomes

extremely   powerful

17

.   This   is   a   strength   for   balance   because   it   lets   campaigns   choose   a   progression

speed that fits the narrative genre (e.g. an isekai might use rapid exponential growth, a gritty seinen might

use slow progression). The presence of quick-reference guides for combat and leveling also aids the GM

(AI) in applying rules consistently. Overall, the mechanics are robust and can be tuned to different tones,

preventing one-size-fits-all pacing.

Weaknesses:  Before   recent   integration,   a   critical   issue   was   that  narrative   pacing   did   not   actually

influence XP or difficulty – the progression module was operating blindly, giving the same XP progression

whether   an   anime   was   “fast-paced   shonen”   or   “slow-burn   drama.”   The   audits   flagged   that  Module   09

(Progression) had “no narrative pacing coordination,” meaning a fast-paced anime profile and a slow-paced

one   would   yield   identical   XP   gains,   contradicting   the   intent

18

.   Similarly,   the   combat   system   and   stat

frameworks were not informed by the narrative profile’s needs (e.g. an action-heavy world vs. a pacifist

world used the same stat defaults). These gaps have been addressed by adding explicit mapping rules – for

example, narrative “Fast-Paced 2/10” now maps to a high XP-per-session model instead of the default

19

. Nonetheless, the fact that this mapping was an afterthought suggests balance issues may still need

fine-tuning. There is a  risk of imbalance  if the GM AI doesn’t perfectly calibrate difficulty to the player’s

power (especially in long campaigns as characters level up). The system provides the tools (e.g. challenge

rating modifiers, injury systems, etc.), but until more playtesting is done, we consider mechanical balance

mostly theoretical. In short, the rules are comprehensive, but ensuring they produce a satisfying difficulty

curve across different genres is an ongoing challenge.

State Management & Memory Persistence

Strengths:  The   AIDM   architecture   treats   game   state   and   memory   as   first-class   citizens.   All   significant

gameplay data is stored in structured JSON schemas (character stats, world state, NPC relationships, quest

flags,   etc.),   reflecting   the   design   principle  “State   as   Truth   –   never   assumed”

4

.   The  State   Manager

(Module 03) can export the entire session state to JSON on command and re-import it later to  resume a

campaign seamlessly

20

. This was validated in testing where after 20+ turns of play, the state export

2

contained  all  stats,  inventory,  NPC  affinities,  quest  progress,  and  even  mid-combat  status,  and  on

import the new session continued without missing a beat

21

22

. Such reliable persistence is critical for

long-form   play.   Meanwhile,   the  Learning   Engine

(Module   02)   maintains   multi-layered   memory

“threads” (core events, character backstory, world lore, etc.) with a heat index and compression to keep

older   memories   relevant   but   summarized

23

.   This   ensures   that   even   across   dozens   of   exchanges   or

multiple sessions, NPCs remember past interactions and story continuity is preserved. An invariant of the

system is that “Memory Persistence” must hold – all important interactions are recorded so the AI doesn’t

forget key player actions or decisions

24

. Additionally, memory was recently expanded to include Narrative

Style  context: the team added a  NARRATIVE_PROFILE entry to state  (and a memory category for genre

storytelling patterns) so that the active genre calibration is never lost and can be reapplied after loads

25

.

Together, these design choices mean AIDM is unusually robust in preserving game continuity compared to

typical AI story generators.

Weaknesses: While the underlying system for state and memory is solid, there are a few areas of concern.

First, the reliance on the user to trigger exports is a potential weakness – if a player forgets to regularly

save (or a long single session exceeds context limits without a save), there is a risk of context loss. The
), but discipline
system will warn or prompt (Session Zero asks “New game or Continue?” to handle loads

26

is required. Second, early audits found certain state items were not tracked until fixes were made – e.g.

originally Module 03 did not track which narrative profile was active or enforce that the loaded profile

persisted, meaning genre calibration could be “lost” between sessions
state’s  active_profile_id  and related fields

25

, but it underscores that any new state variable must be

27

. This has been fixed with the

carefully integrated everywhere (validation, import, export) to avoid leaks. Finally, the memory compression

and retention strategy is untested at extreme scales – we assume the hierarchical memory will condense

older   events,   but   if   a   campaign   ran   e.g.   1000   exchanges,   would   important   early   details   still   surface

appropriately? Only two of the eight acceptance tests have fully passed at this point (others, like a 20+

exchange   memory   stress   test,   are   still   pending)

28

,   so   some   caution   remains   until   those   long-term

memory  tests  are  verified.  In  summary,  state  and  memory  handling  is  a  major  strength  of  AIDM,  with

explicit design to avoid common pitfalls, but it will need real-world exercise to prove its reliability over very

extended play.

UX Clarity and Accessibility

Strengths: The AIDM system is designed to be player-friendly and transparent despite its complexity. A

key guiding rule is keeping the player in control – the AI DM never overrides or retcons player actions, and

all player dialogue is echoed verbatim in the narrative (the system will enhance description around it, but

not   alter   the   player’s   own   words)

24

.   This   approach   builds   player   trust   and   clarity,   since   you   always

recognize your input in the story output. The Session Zero onboarding is very structured and clear: it walks

the player through a 5-phase setup (system checks, genre calibration, world building, character creation,

then   an   opening   scene)   with   explicit   prompts   at   each   step

29

.   This   ensures   that   even   new   users

understand the flow and can provide their preferences (for tone, violence level, pacing, etc.) before the

game proper begins. The language in instructions and outputs avoids technical jargon where possible – for

example, earlier verbose meta-protocol messages were replaced with simple numbered steps and friendly

confirmations

. Another plus is the “Sacred Rule” of Player Agency (PRESENT → ASK → STOP → WAIT)
defined in Module 12, which ensures that if the AI is unsure or a sensitive situation arises, it asks the player

30

rather   than   forging   ahead

31

.   This   prevents   the   AI   from   ever   forcing   content   the   player   might   be

uncomfortable   with,   enhancing   accessibility   for   different   comfort   levels.   Overall,   the   system’s   UX

3

emphasizes  clarity, consent, and collaboration, treating the player as the director while the AI handles

the heavy lifting.

Weaknesses:  Despite efforts to streamline it, AIDM v2 is still a  complex system to set up and run. The

user must either use the provided loader (copy-paste a large prompt with numerous URLs) or manually

upload ~54 files in the correct order

32

 – this is far from plug-and-play, especially for non-technical users.

The reliance on a high-context LLM (discussed later) also means the average user can’t just open ChatGPT

and have this work; they need access to a model that can handle the full instruction set, which is a barrier to

accessibility. In terms of in-game UX, there may be moments of heavy system messaging (e.g. when an

error is detected, the Error Recovery module might output a technical-sounding correction). The team has

minimized  this  (ensuring  the  AI  apologizes  briefly  and  fixes  state  without  long-winded  justifications

33

34

), but maintaining an immersive experience while system mechanics operate is an ongoing balancing

act.   Another   potential   issue   is  discoverability   of   commands:   AIDM   supports   meta-commands   like
[META: Export]  or asking the AI to initiate certain protocols, but new players must read documentation

or rely on the Session Zero to learn these. Without a GUI, some players could get confused about how to

trigger   things   like   a   save/load   or   research   action.   These   are   relatively   minor   quibbles   given   the   target

audience (TTRPG enthusiasts who are likely to RTFM), but they show that user experience, while generally

well-thought-out, can still be improved  – perhaps via an in-game help summary or more prompts to

guide players who stray from the expected flow.

Code and Schema Quality

Strengths: The project’s codebase (though “code” here is mostly markdown and JSON) exhibits a high level
of organization and quality. All game data structures are defined in formal schemas (for characters, world

state, powers, etc.), which means the AI is always writing to a consistent format – this was meant to reduce

hallucination or format errors, and provides a clear contract for what data exists

35

. The use of JSON for

state also makes it easy to validate and even potentially interface with external tools (should one choose to

parse the game state with a program). The content within the instruction modules is carefully edited for

consistency and lack of ambiguity. Multiple audit rounds (instruction fluff audit, integration audit, token

audit) were performed, which caught and fixed many issues like redundant rules, inconsistent terminology,

or overly verbose examples. For instance, the fluff audit identified and removed redundant examples and

meta-commentary across modules (e.g. trimming a 220-line embedded JSON example down to a 30-line

summary reference)

36

37

. The result is that the instructions focus on  essential logic and algorithms

(often in bullet lists or pseudo-code form) rather than lengthy prose, which reduces the chance of the AI

misinterpreting them. Moreover, the project maintainers established design invariants – e.g. every player

input goes through Intent Classification, every output goes through consistency checks

38

 – and the

code   reflects   these   rules   systematically.   The   modular   separation   of   concerns   is   also   a   sign   of   good

architecture: if the combat rules need tweaking, they reside mainly in one file and a few related library

tables, rather than being scattered. Overall, the technical quality and maintainability of AIDM v2’s “source” is

impressively high for a prompt-based system.

Weaknesses:  One challenge in a system this complex is ensuring  documentation stays up to date  and

that   all   modules   remain   in   sync   after   changes.   The   audit   of   Module   13   integration   revealed   that

documentation   within   modules   was   incomplete,   e.g.   Module   13’s   own   notes   listed   only   3   modules

integrating it and missed others, and Module 12’s notes didn’t even mention Module 13

39

40

. This kind of

oversight could confuse future developers or contributors about how things actually interact. It was likely

caused by the rapid addition of Narrative Calibration late in development, and the subsequent scramble to

4

integrate   it.   The   team   did   catch   and   correct   these   integration   docs,   but   it   highlights   how  any   future

additions must update references across many files to avoid inconsistencies. In terms of code, since the

system relies on the LLM following the markdown instructions, there is always a risk that a slight format

mistake or ambiguity could lead to a model misunderstanding (unlike traditional code, there’s no compiler

to catch errors). The test results (with several tests still failing or partial) suggest there may be minor bugs

or omissions in the logic that need resolving (for example, a test might fail if the AI doesn’t deduct MP

correctly or if an NPC’s memory flag wasn’t set due to a typo in a schema field name). These are normal in a

complex   system   and   will   likely   be   fixed   as   tests   are   iterated.   Lastly,   while   not   a   flaw   per   se,   the  JSON

schemas contribute a lot of token overhead  (over 33K tokens just for the 8 schema files)

41

  and are

somewhat verbose. They could perhaps be slimmed down or compressed if token pressure becomes an

issue. However, overall the code/schema quality is strong, with most technical debt already addressed by

the exhaustive audits.

Scalability and Context Discipline

Strengths: Scalability was a critical focus in AIDM v2, and the project succeeded in dramatically reducing
its context footprint. Phase 1 of development saw a 62% reduction in total tokens for the core instruction

modules (from ~142k tokens to ~54k) through aggressive editing and removal of fluff

42

. This optimization,

combined with splitting content into  Tier 1  vs  Tier 2  loads, means that the entire base system now fits in

roughly 87k tokens – only ~43% of the targeted 200k context window

43

. In practice, AIDM pre-loads just

the most essential modules, indices, and schemas initially, and holds others in reserve. It uses a  “lazy-

loading” architecture: high-level indexes for narrative profiles and genre tropes (~6k tokens total after

optimization) are loaded upfront, but individual detailed profiles or trope files (which can be thousands of

words each) are only fetched if needed during play

44

. This discipline ensures that, for example, if the

campaign   never   involves   a   Slice-of-Life   scenario,   the   slice_of_life   tropes   file   never   eats   up   context.   The

design target of 200k tokens suggests the team is forward-looking to upcoming large-context models (e.g.

GPT-4 128k or beyond). Within that budget,  Session Zero plus all Tier-1 content now consumes ~18.5k

tokens, down from 29k initially

45

46

, greatly improving efficiency. By maintaining an index of content

and   structured   references,   AIDM   effectively   implements   a   manual   retrieval-augmented   generation

approach. This scalable design means the system can handle long campaigns and complex worlds without

running out of context – it leaves plenty of room for the  actual gameplay conversation  on top of the

loaded instructions.

Weaknesses:  The flip side of targeting a 200k context is that  AIDM is not readily usable on smaller-

context models. In 2025, only select models (like Claude 100k or GPT-4 128k beta) can accommodate this,

so the scalability gains are somewhat moot for typical users with 4k-32k models. If someone attempted to

run AIDM on a 32k context, they would likely exceed it just by loading the core (87k tokens) – making the

system effectively inaccessible without high-end model access. Another concern is that, while the project

optimized static content, the dynamic content (gameplay logs) will grow with each turn. A 200k window

can host a lot of dialogue, but a truly epic campaign might still approach that limit eventually. The team’s

strategy is to use state exports to “hard reset” context when needed, but that requires careful planning.

There’s also the assumption that future models will handle 100k+ tokens efficiently; if not, performance lag

or increased error rates could occur when context is maxed out. Additionally, the reliance on the model to

strictly follow the lazy-loading protocol (only use libraries when instructed) could falter – e.g. the model

might try to elaborate on tropes even if the file isn’t loaded, potentially hallucinating details. The discipline is

mostly enforced by how prompts are structured, but it’s hard to guarantee an LLM won’t stray when given

so   much   knowledge.   In   summary,   AIDM   v2   is   highly   disciplined   in   context   management   and   ready   for

5

scaling   up,   but   it’s   inherently   married   to   the   assumption   of   very   large   context   availability,   which   is   a

pragmatic bet on future tech that may limit its near-term use.

Integration Robustness

Strengths: After Phase 1–8 fixes, the AIDM system now exhibits much stronger cross-module integration.

The previously isolated Narrative Calibration module (13) has been woven into the fabric of the game logic

via a “mechanical scaffolding” approach. The team added a new section in Module 13 that maps narrative

profile parameters to concrete mechanics – for example, mapping a profile’s “Power Fantasy” scale to which

power-growth   model   to   use   (from   Module   12),   or   mapping   “Fast/Slow   Pace”   scales   to   an   XP   multiplier

regimen (Module 09)

19

. They also updated all 12 core narrative profiles with  “Mechanical Scaffolding”

reference   sections  that   explicitly   state   how   that   anime’s   narrative   style   translates   to   stat   frameworks,

power system rules, XP rates, etc.

47

48

. This effectively bridges the gap between the creative narrative

content and the rule-driven mechanics. Additionally,  state integration  was improved: the State Manager

now knows about the narrative profile in play, ensuring things like genre-specific rules persist between

25

.   Importantly,   several   previously   missing   links   have   been   established:   Module   02   (learning/
sessions
memory) now has a narrative style memory category, Module 01’s cognitive engine documentation now

mentions routing intents through narrative context, Module 09 (progression) acknowledges fast vs slow

narrative pacing in its XP logic, etc. The integration score for Module 13 went from 4/13 modules up to

essentially   13/13   modules   aware   of   it   after   these   changes

49

47

.   This  holistic   connectivity  is   a   big

architectural win – it means the AI DM’s subsystems “speak the same language” regarding narrative vs

mechanics. The architecture remains modular, but it’s now undergirded by a network of references and

shared   parameters,   yielding   a   more  cohesive   system   behavior.   The   design   also   emphasizes  robust

fallbacks  – e.g. if a library file isn’t loaded, the AI will still try to continue using generic logic rather than

stopping (the System Initialization includes fallback rules) and the Error Recovery module is there to catch

any consistency slips. All of this contributes to an architecture that can handle a wide range of situations

without breaking the game flow.

Weaknesses: Despite the vast improvements, integration is not perfect yet. Some content libraries are still

only loosely integrated – for instance, the Genre Trope libraries are now referenced in profiles (usage notes)

in a few cases, but AIDM likely doesn’t automatically pull in a trope template unless explicitly instructed. A

tester could still encounter a situation where, say, they’re playing Hunter x Hunter and the system fails to

utilize   the   generic   shonen   training-arc   structure   because   that   link   depends   on   how   the   prompt   was

engineered. Ideally, these connections would be fully two-way and automatic, but currently they rely on the

profile author having added a note (“See shonen_tropes.md for training arc”)

50

. If any profile missed such

a note, that integration could still be overlooked. Moreover, the  integration fixes were done rapidly (in

about 8-10 hours of work) just a week ago, and have not been extensively field-tested

51

. There may be

edge cases where the new scaffolding rules conflict or cause unintended behavior. For example, if an anime

profile has an unusual combination of scales (perhaps contradictory, like “Fast-Paced but Slow progression”

– which could happen if the profile is user-generated without clear logic), the scaffolding might apply an XP

multiplier  that  doesn’t  actually  make  sense,  and  we’d  need  a  human  to  adjust.  Additionally,  integration

across multiple anime inspirations (the “fusion” scenario) is still a high-risk area – combining three different

power systems and narrative styles is inherently complex, and while AIDM has a plan for it, it’s one of the

tests   that   hasn’t   fully   passed   yet.  Multi-agent   integration  (if   we   ever   deploy   separate   AI   agents   for

different roles) is also not built-in – the modules assume a single AI running everything in one context, so

distributing   them   would   be   non-trivial.   In   summary,   current   integration   is   vastly   improved   and   likely

6

sufficient for MVP, but some weak links remain and new integration patterns (like multi-genre fusions)

are not yet proven stable.

System Readiness for Extended Use

•

Long-Form   Campaign   Play   (10+   sessions): Readiness:  Moderate-High.   AIDM   v2   was   explicitly

designed with long campaigns in mind – the presence of slow progression options and narrative

pivot points that span 20+ sessions shows the intent

52

. The state persistence mechanism allows

campaigns to be saved and resumed indefinitely, mitigating context limits. Narrative profiles and

progression curves account for up to Tier 5 epic levels, which would likely only be reached in multi-

session   play

53

.   That   said,   true   long-term   play   has   not   been   fully   validated   (some   memory

coherence   tests   for   20+   exchanges   are   still   pending).   The   system   is  conceptually  ready   for   long

campaigns in terms of rules and data structures; each session’s key outcomes can be exported, and

leveling is balanced for the long haul. But it will need real-world testing to ensure the AI doesn’t start

to lose nuance after many sessions. In general, the foundations (exportable state, memory threads,

tiered   progression)   are   there   for   multi-session   endurance.   We   anticipate   AIDM   can   handle

campaigns of 10+ sessions, though the first few long campaigns might expose minor continuity

bugs to iron out.

•

Multi-Agent or Distributed AI Deployment: Readiness:  Low. The current architecture assumes a

single LLM instance acting as the sole game master, with all modules loaded into one context

54

.

There is no built-in support for splitting duties between multiple AI agents. In a distributed scenario

(for example, one AI handling narrative and another handling combat calculations, or a client-server

model where the server pre-processes rules), significant modifications would be needed. Positively,

the strict modularization could, in theory, allow isolating modules – e.g. an API could host the State

Manager or a combat simulator separately. But AIDM provides no out-of-the-box mechanism for

that;   the   modules   are   written   for   co-location   in   one   prompt.   Achieving   multi-agent   deployment

would also require a shared memory/state channel between agents (since one holds the world state,

another might handle NPC dialogue, etc.). Right now, state is stored as JSON which could be an

interchange format, but coordinating multiple AIs with it hasn’t been tested. The roadmap for v3+

does mention  collaborative multiplayer  which could imply multiple players or AI agents

55

, but

those are future plans. For v2, if one wanted distributed AI (say running certain heavy tasks on a

second model), it would be a custom extension. So as it stands, the system is not ready for multi-

agent use  – it’s best run by one sufficiently powerful model. The architecture doesn’t  block  such a

development, but it doesn’t facilitate it either.

•

Post-v2   Expansion   (new   modules,   genres,   AI   agents): Readiness:  High   in   content,   Medium   in

architecture. Adding new content like modules and libraries was a core design goal – the system is

very extensible in that regard. New narrative profiles or trope libraries can be plugged in simply by

writing new markdown files and listing them in the indexes, with no code changes (the repository

explicitly encourages “additional narrative profiles” and “community-contributed genre tropes” going

forward

56

).  The  modular  structure  also  means  you  could  drop  in  a  new  mechanic  module  (for

example, a “magic crafting” module 14) without disrupting existing ones, as long as it interfaces

through the state or defined hooks. The  Scope Change Protocol  ensures any new core system is

evaluated for alignment and requires tests, but it does allow new libraries freely

57

. So adding more

anime   genres,   or   even   entirely   new   game   genres,   is   feasible.   Expansion   to   new   AI   agents   (like

integrating an image-generation AI for illustrations, or a voice agent) is in the roadmap (multimodal

7

plans are noted for Phase 2)

58

. The text-based core would not conflict with adding such features,

though   it   might   require   additional   prompt   modules.   The   area   that’s   less   straightforward   is

expanding core architecture features – e.g. implementing a  Constitutional AI layer or emotional

AI (which they plan) will require careful insertion into the pipeline. The system’s clarity about intent

analysis   and   memory   could   help   slot   those   in,   but   it’s   untested.   In   summary,  genre/content

expansion is very ready (the community could start writing a Mecha or Sports anime profile today),

and   the   maintainers   anticipated   this   by   modular   design.   Larger   architectural   additions   (new   AI

subsystems)   are   possible   but   will   need   the   same   rigorous   integration   approach   that   Narrative

Calibration required – it can be done, but with caution.

•

Modding and Community Contribution: Readiness: High. Because AIDM v2 is essentially driven by

markdown files and schemas, it’s quite amenable to modding. There’s no complex code compilation

or  AI  model  fine-tuning  required  to  add  or  tweak  things  –  a  community  member  with  a  GitHub

account can contribute a new trope library or adjust a profile’s values and submit it. The maintainers

already signaled openness to community content like more profiles and templates

56

. The content

is also human-readable, which lowers the barrier for creative contributors (as opposed to needing to
know a programming language). The risk with mods is ensuring they follow the established format

and   don’t   break   the   balance   or   consistency;   however,   the   existence   of   schemas   and   guidelines

mitigates this (contributors can validate their JSON against the schema, etc.). Additionally, since all

instructions are visible, power users could “mod” their own sessions by editing certain values if they

really wanted to house-rule something. The only area that might be hard for modders is if they want

to change core logic – e.g. a different dice system – because then you’d have to edit the instructions

in   multiple   places   and   re-run   tests.   But   adding   content   (new   worlds,   powers,   items,   quests)   is

straightforward. One caution: given the large context and somewhat technical setup, the community

of users/modders will likely be smaller and more hardcore by nature. But those who do engage will

find   a   well-documented,   modular   system   to   build   on.   Overall,   AIDM   v2   is  built   like   a   content

platform, so we anticipate strong support for modding and community-driven expansions in post-

v2.

Architectural Patterns Enabling or Blocking Key Goals

•

Resilience to Unpredictable Player Behavior: The architecture includes several patterns to handle

out-of-bound  inputs  or  errors  gracefully.   The  Cognitive   Engine  classifies   every   player   input  into

categories (dialogue, action, meta-command, etc.), which helps prevent the AI from getting confused

by   unusual   player   statements   –   e.g.   if   the   player   suddenly   speaks   out-of-character   or   gives   a

command, the system recognizes it and routes it appropriately rather than treating it as story text

59

. The  Player Agency safeguards  (Module 12) ensure that if a player tries to do something the

system  deems  disallowed  or  game-breaking,   the   AI   will  pause   and   ask   for   clarification  instead  of

ignoring or railroadingly correcting the player

31

. Additionally, the presence of Error Recovery as a

dedicated   module   means   even   if   something   unpredictable   happens   (like   a   continuity   error   or

impossible   player   action),   the   AI   is   instructed   to   acknowledge   it   calmly,   correct   the   state,   and

continue the game without derailing

33

60

. This pattern of “catch and continue” is essential for

resilience – it turns potential game-breaking moments into minor speed bumps. On the other hand,

one blocking pattern is the heavy reliance on the AI’s compliance with instructions. If a player does

something truly off-the-wall that wasn’t anticipated in any module, the AI might still fumble (the

system can’t have hard-coded rules for every crazy stunt). In such cases, the fail-safe is that the AI

should default to common sense or ask the player – which is generally a good approach. Overall, the

8

design   ethos   “fail   gracefully”

4

  permeates   AIDM:   it   tries   to   handle   the   unexpected   by   either

falling back to simpler narrative or involving the player in resolving the issue. This enables resilience,

as no single unplanned input should completely break the experience.

•

Fallback Handling for Hallucinations or Missing Information: AIDM v2 explicitly tries to prevent

or mitigate hallucinations, especially during world creation. The  Anime Integration module (07) is

designed   to   perform   live   web   searches   for   lore   rather   than   letting   the   LLM   invent   details,   and

importantly it then presents the findings to the player for verification

61

62

. This human-in-the-

loop   pattern   ensures   that   any   fetched   information   (or   any   AI   guesses,   if   it   had   to   guess)   are

confirmed before becoming canon. In cases where the AI doesn’t know something and can’t use the

internet (e.g. a very obscure or fake anime), the system is instructed to  admit uncertainty and

prompt the player to fill in the details  rather than hallucinate. This is actually tested: for a fake

anime, AIDM  must not invent lore  – the test will fail if it does

63

. This indicates a strong anti-

hallucination stance: the AI is trained to say “I’m not familiar, can you tell me more?” or use the

Research  Protocol  which  explicitly  requires  user  confirmation  of  any  found  info.  If  a  module  or

library is missing (say the player references a genre the system doesn’t have a trope file for), the
System Initialization’s fallback principle would have the AI continue with generic logic and possibly

log a warning. The modular design means absence of one part doesn’t paralyze the whole – for

example, if web search is unavailable, the instructions suggest the user manually provide info or the

AI proceed with its own knowledge but caveats

64

. These patterns enable robust fallback behavior:

the system either seeks truth via research or defers to the player, which significantly reduces the

chance   of   egregious   hallucinations.   A   potential   blocking   factor   is   that   these   fallbacks   might

introduce delays or extra dialogue – e.g. the AI stopping to ask “Is this correct?” frequently could bog

down the flow if not managed. However, it’s a worthwhile trade-off for reliability. Transparency and

user   collaboration   are   the   core   strategy   to   handle   missing   info,   and   AIDM   implements   that

consistently.

•

Accurate Genre Emulation with Conflicting Profiles: When multiple genre influences or conflicting

narrative profiles come into play, AIDM leverages a pattern of decomposition into numeric scales

and templates. Each narrative profile breaks down an anime’s style into ~10 numerical scales (e.g.

humor vs seriousness, strategy vs spectacle in combat, power fantasy level, pacing speed) and a set

of tropes

65

. This allows the system to quantitatively compare and blend profiles if needed. In a

“fusion” scenario (e.g. the player wants Naruto + My Hero Academia + Solo Leveling together), AIDM

doesn’t blindly mash them; instead Module 07/13 will extract the key “DNA” from each (like Chakra

energy = internal power, Quirks = innate powers, Solo Leveling system = external RPG system) and

attempt a unified framework

66

67

. The pattern here is to find a common denominator (in that

example,  treating  it  as  “Chakra  =  trainable  energy,  Quirks  =  genetic  ability,  both  quantified  by  a

System”)   so   that   the   mechanics   don’t   conflict

68

69

.   To   achieve   accurate   genre   emulation,   the

system   also   employs  bidirectional   linking   between   generic   genre   templates   and   specific

profiles  – e.g. if you load a profile that is Shonen, it now (after fixes) will point you to use Shonen

trope structures

70

; conversely, a trope file might mention to consider certain profile examples. This

templated approach means even if two profiles conflict (say one is very comedic, one very dark), the

AI can modulate output by referencing the underlying scales (perhaps ending up at a mid-point tone

if both are active).  Blocking patterns  could still occur if the profiles are truly incompatible (e.g.

trying to mix a no-combat slice-of-life with a high-combat shonen – the system might struggle to

reconcile “zero combat” vs “lots of combat”). There is no magic bullet for that beyond the AI asking

the player to prioritize one. However, the explicit numeric scales at least make the conflict visible to

9

the   AI   (it   can   see   one   profile   has   Combat   Emphasis   0   and   another   has   8,   and   then   decide).   In

summary,  prompt   formalization   of   genre   elements  (scales,   tags,   templates)   enables   AIDM   to

emulate genres accurately and even handle multiple at once in a principled way, though extreme

conflicts will still require human direction.

•

Prompt Engineering Scalability for Future Models: The AIDM v2 design shows foresight in prompt

engineering that will scale to more powerful models. A key pattern is that it treats the  LLM as an

interpreter   of   structured   instructions  rather   than   a   pure   few-shot   storyteller.   The   prompt   is

broken   into   logical   modules,   each   with   clear   markdown   sections,   tables,   or   JSON   schemas.   This

structure means as models get larger context windows and better adherence, AIDM can simply load

more detail or more modules without confusion. The team already demonstrated this by optimizing

and fitting the whole system into ~43% of a 200k window

43

. As future models perhaps support

500k tokens, AIDM could include even more detailed libraries or additional modules (for example,

adding a full “emotional AI” module) by following the same structured approach. Another important

pattern is avoidance of hardcoded examples in favor of rules. Many older AI Dungeon paradigms

relied on lengthy example transcripts to get style – AIDM instead encodes style in data (profiles,
tropes) and algorithms (e.g. the narration calibration rules). This means it’s less dependent on any

one model’s quirks and should port more easily to new models (which might have different base

knowledge   or   tokenization).   The   use   of   indices   and   lazy   loading   is   essentially   a   manual   form   of

retrieval that could be automated with future retrieval-augmented models – AIDM’s design would

mesh well with a system that can fetch knowledge as needed, since it already compartmentalized

that   knowledge.   In   terms   of   blocking   patterns,   one   concern   is   that   the   prompt   is  heavily

engineered for current model limitations (like avoiding hallucination via explicit verification steps).

If future models are dramatically more knowledgeable or have built-in tools, some of AIDM’s verbose

instructions might be unnecessary or even counter-productive. The devs will need to prune or adjust

instructions   as   models   evolve,   to   avoid   over-constraining   an   AI   that   could   handle   more   abstract

instructions. But overall, the modular, data-driven prompt style is very forward-compatible – it will

scale   with   context   size   and   can   be   adapted   as   needed.   Essentially,   AIDM’s   prompt   is  an   expert

system layered on top of an AI, and that philosophy will remain useful as long as we use prompts

to control AI behavior.

System Scorecard (0–10)

•

Structural Modularity: 9/10  – The system is cleanly divided into independent modules with well-

defined roles (13 instruction files, 8 schemas, etc.), exemplifying separation of concerns. This makes it

maintainable and extensible. The only reason this isn’t a 10 is that some modules were initially siloed

too much (requiring later integration work), indicating a bit more coupling was needed than first

assumed. Still, the architecture is highly modular by design

71

 and proved its flexibility by allowing

major features to be added in without rewriting the whole system.

•

Instructional Clarity: 8/10 – After extensive editing, the instructions are concise and use structured

formatting that an LLM can parse easily

2

. There’s minimal ambiguity in what the AI should do –

rules are often in bullet lists or numbered steps, and examples are brief. The only drawbacks are the

sheer size (even concise, there are ~30 files to load, which could overwhelm or confuse a model if not

done correctly) and the potential for occasional overlap in instructions. Overall, though, clarity is

strong: the AI gets a clear mandate from each module, and conflicting directives have largely been

eliminated.

10

•

Narrative   Fidelity: 9/10  –   AIDM   shines   at   capturing   anime   narrative   style.   The   inclusion   of   rich

narrative profiles and trope libraries means the AI has a deep reservoir of genre knowledge to draw

from,   resulting   in   storytelling   that   feels   true   to   the   source   material.   Test   scenarios   show   it   can

produce   distinct   tones   (isekai   vs   shonen   vs   slice-of-life)   effectively

72

.   Moreover,   the   narrative

calibration   uses   quantitative   scales   to   fine-tune   tone   and   pacing   on   the   fly.   Early   on,   there   was

concern that focusing on narrative might divorce it from gameplay, but the profiles themselves are

extremely faithful to their anime inspirations (one audit noted “storytelling quality is exceptional”

in these 12K-word profiles)

73

. With the new scaffolding ensuring those narrative elements correctly

influence the game, we award a high score here. The only reason it’s not 10 is that we’ve yet to see it

handle  every  edge case (e.g. mixing two very different genres is untested territory). But for known

genres and styles, it nails the narrative feel.

•

Mechanical Coherence: 7.5/10 – This saw huge improvement with the integration fixes. Originally,

mechanical coherence was maybe a 5 (disjointed subsystems), but now the mechanics and narrative

“talk to each other” via defined mappings

19

. The combat, progression, stat, and power systems

all generally make sense together and are consistent with the anime logic (e.g. shonen worlds use
shonen-appropriate   stat   frameworks,   XP   curves   match   narrative   pacing,   etc.).   The   internal

consistency of the mechanics is solid: rules for HP, damage, leveling, etc., are clearly defined and

cross-referenced. We still leave a bit of caution in the score because these many moving parts have

not been proven in a long playtest; balancing might need tweaking once players truly push the limits

(e.g. does the XP curve actually result in satisfying level-ups? Are there any infinite power exploits?).

Also,   a   few   mechanical   sub-systems   (like   the   dice   resolution   for   skill   checks)   haven’t   been   as

prominently   tested   in   the   narrative   context,   so   we   assume   coherence   but   haven’t   witnessed   it.

Overall,   it’s   a   well-structured   mechanical   framework,   now   made   coherent   by   the   narrative<-

>mechanic scaffolding, with just minor uncertainties keeping it shy of perfect.

•

Execution Resilience: 8/10 – The system is built to be robust during execution. Its resilience comes

from features like the error recovery module (which can catch and correct mistakes on the fly) and

the invariant checks (state validation, etc.) that run regularly

38

. In testing, the AI is expected to

gracefully handle errors (acknowledge and fix them) without breaking character or needing a restart

74

  – a key resilience metric that AIDM meets with its design. The prompts also include fallback

instructions   for   missing   capabilities   (e.g.   if   web   search   fails,   instruct   the   user   to   provide   info)

ensuring the game can continue rather than halt

64

. We also saw resilience in how the AI deals with

user inputs: it classifies them and can handle meta-commands or wildly off-narrative requests by

either obeying them or gently steering back, rather than collapsing. The reason it’s 8 and not higher

is that, until we run all acceptance tests, we can’t be sure there isn’t a scenario that will throw it off.

For instance, multi-anime fusion is a complex execution that might still have some bugs. Additionally,

resilience in extremely long sessions (where an early loaded module might scroll out of context) is

untested. However, given the “degrade gracefully” principle in place

4

 and all the safeguards, we

have confidence in strong execution resilience overall.

•

Scalability (Token and Context Management): 9/10  – AIDM v2 demonstrates excellence in token

discipline.   The   team   managed   to   fit   the   system   in   roughly   ~87k   tokens   (including   schemas)

43

,

which is remarkable given the ambition – and they have a strategy to only load what is needed when

it’s needed

44

. The use of optimized indexes (62% reduction in size)

46

  and splitting content into

tiers shows a forward-thinking approach to large context usage. In practice, this means even as the

game scales in complexity (more NPCs, more lore), the context is not cluttered with unused data. For

11

models that can handle it (100k+ context), this system scales to fill the available space efficiently but

not wastefully. It loses a point only because it inherently requires those very large contexts – it’s not

scalable downwards to smaller models or contexts, which is a trade-off they knowingly made. Also, if

one imagines scaling to  truly massive  worlds, eventually the context window could still become a

bottleneck (but at that point we’re beyond v2’s scope). Within its design envelope, context scalability

is nearly optimal.

•

Accessibility   (Player   &   GM   Usability): 8/10  –   From   a   player   perspective,   AIDM   tries   to   be   as

accessible   as   a   complex   RPG   system   can   be.   The   guided   session   setup,   the   way   the   AI   always

explains or offers choices rather than assuming, and the absence of heavy jargon in outputs are all

positives.   The  player   agency   focus  ensures   a   new   player   won’t   feel   railroaded   or   confused   by

unexplained   AI   decisions

75

  –   the   AI   explicitly   asks   for   input   when   needed.   Also,   the   thorough

documentation (guides, quick references) acts as a safety net for understanding the system. For a

GM (here the “GM” is the AI itself or the developer overseeing it), the architecture is transparent and

configurable   –   one   can   easily   adjust   difficulty   by   toggling   a   parameter   or   edit   content   files   to

customize the experience. The main accessibility drawbacks are the  setup complexity  (noted earlier,
needing   a   large   prompt   and   model)   and   the   fact   that   players   still   must   learn   a   bit   of   the

“UI” (knowing when to say META commands or how to format input for character creation). These

issues keep it at 8. In essence: in-game accessibility (ease of play, clarity of narration) is very high,

but  system accessibility  (ease of getting it running) is medium. Averaging those, we give a solid

8/10 for a system that largely succeeds in being user-friendly given the inherent complexity of a

tabletop RPG simulator.

•

Extensibility (Modding & Genre Expansion): 9/10  – AIDM v2 is built almost like a framework or

platform, making it highly extensible. Need a new anime setting? Just write a new profile file and

drop it in – the system will incorporate it via the narrative profile index. Want to support a new game

genre (say cyberpunk or Westerns)? In principle you could author a new set of trope libraries and

modules for it and plug them into the loader. The separation of content (libraries) from process

(modules) means mods and expansions won’t break core logic as long as they follow the format. The

project explicitly allows new libraries without needing special approval (so it’s designed to grow in

content)

57

.   The   reason   we   don’t   give   a   full   10   is   that   certain   types   of   extensions   (new   core

mechanics or systems) do require careful work – e.g. adding a “sanity mechanic” or a “card battle

subsystem” would probably involve writing a new instruction module and making sure it integrates

with   state   and   other   modules.   That’s   doable   but   requires   understanding   the   architecture.

Additionally, community contributors will need to adhere to the style and balance, which is more an

organizational  challenge  than  a  technical  one.  But  given  that  no  coding  is  required  (just  editing

markdown), the bar for community-driven extensibility is low. We expect v2 will serve as a strong

base for future expansions (they already plan additional genres and features in the roadmap), and

the   architecture   can   accommodate   those   without   major   refactoring.   Thus,   it   earns   a  9/10   for

extensibility, limited only by the need for continued careful integration when adding truly novel

systems.

Remaining Risks and Liabilities

•

Incomplete   Test   Coverage:  As   of   this   audit,   only  2   of   8   acceptance   tests   have   fully   passed

(TEST-001   and   TEST-004)

28

.   Several   critical   scenarios   –   like   multi-anime   fusion,   long   session

persistence, memory coherence over 20+ exchanges, and genre adaptation edge cases – remain

12

only   partially   validated.   This   indicates   a   risk   that   undiscovered   issues   (logical   bugs   or   prompt

missteps) persist in those areas. Until all tests pass, there’s a liability that the system may break or

produce suboptimal results under certain conditions (e.g. mixing three power systems, or resuming

a very complex saved game). The team should prioritize executing and debugging the remaining

tests to reach full coverage.

•

Multi-Genre Fusion Complexity:  The scenario of blending multiple anime or genre influences is

identified   as   high-risk.   While   the   design   has   a   plan   for   it,  coherently   merging   disparate   rule

systems  (for example, Naruto ninjutsu + MHA quirks + Solo Leveling RPG mechanics) is inherently

complex. There’s a liability that such fusions could result in contradictions or an overload of context

as multiple libraries load at once. Test-002 specifically targets this, and until it passes, we consider

multi-genre campaigns a technical liability – the system might need further tuning or perhaps even a

dedicated “fusion coordinator” module to handle it gracefully.

•

Hallucination & Lore Accuracy:  Although AIDM has safeguards against lore hallucination, it’s still

dependent on the base LLM’s behavior. If the web research step fails or the model’s knowledge cutoff

is hit, the AI might be tempted to fill in blanks. The test for fake anime requires zero hallucination as

“CRITICAL”

63

 – if this fails in practice, it “breaks trust” and undermines the whole experience

76

. So

far, we haven’t seen evidence of hallucinations in testing, but it remains a risk if a user goes outside

common   anime   or   presses   for   obscure   details.   Continual   emphasis   in   prompts   on   admitting

uncertainty is necessary. This is more of an AI behavior risk than an architecture flaw, but it’s worth

noting as a liability to monitor during deployment.

•

Context Limit Dependency: AIDM’s vast content is an asset, but it’s also a liability in environments

without large context models. The requirement of ~100k tokens context (ideally 200k for comfort)

means the system is tied to cutting-edge model availability. If for any reason such models are not

available,   or   if   usage   cost   is   prohibitive,   AIDM   cannot   function   as   intended.   This   is   a   business/

technical risk – the architecture might need a contingency for a “light mode” or else it’s locked out of

mainstream   use   for   now.   Additionally,   even   with   a   large   context,   extremely   long   single   sessions

(without   using   save/reload)   could   eventually   exhaust   the   window,   and   the   game   would   need   to

enforce a break. We consider the reliance on a massive context a scalability liability – manageable,

but present.

•

Integration Gaps in Niche Areas: While core integration of narrative and mechanics has been fixed,

a few gaps remain. Notably, some  Genre Trope libraries are marked “skeletal/incomplete”  and

not deeply integrated

77

 – e.g. Seinen and Slice-of-Life trope files are assumed comprehensive but

were not heavily referenced. If a player leans heavily into those genres, the AI might not leverage all

tropes effectively. Also, certain mechanics like the Common Mechanics libraries (stat frameworks,

skill taxonomies)  were noted as not referenced in narrative profiles

78

; if that integration wasn’t

fully added, the AI could ignore those guidance tables. These represent minor but existent liabilities

where some written content may not be utilized, essentially dead weight or missed opportunity until

linked. It won’t break the system, but it could reduce the quality of genre emulation in those cases.

•

Overlapping or Redundant Logic:  The audit revealed redundancy (Module 12 vs 13) which was

resolved,   but   there’s   a   risk   that   other   subtle   overlaps   exist.   For   example,   Module   05   (Narrative

Systems) and Module 13 both deal with narrative rules – if an instruction in Module 05 contradicts

the   new   calibration   logic   in   Module   13,   the   AI   might   get   confused.   The   team   tried   to   update

13

references (e.g. making Module 05 explicitly say Module 13 filters narrative rules

79

), but there is a

lingering liability that not every reference was caught. We should especially watch for edge cases of

power scaling (Module 12’s tier system vs. Module 13’s scales) and error handling (Module 10 vs.

others) that might contain overlap. Any such redundancy can usually be fixed by minor prompt edits,

but only if identified.

•

Unproven   Multi-Player   or   Multi-Agent   use:  Although   multi-player   support   is   a   future   goal,

currently the system hasn’t been tested with multiple human players in one session or any form of

multiple AI GMs. If someone attempted a multiplayer scenario (two players and the AI DM), the turn-

taking   and   agency   rules   might   need   adjustment   –   for   instance,   the   system   might   need   to   track

whose turn it is to speak. Right now, it assumes one player input at a time. This is a design limitation

and not expected in v2, but it is a liability to note if marketing to groups. Likewise, using multiple AIs

(for example, one AI per important NPC to simulate free dialogue) isn’t supported and could conflict

with the central memory store. These are more future expansion risks, but worth keeping in mind as

a limitation of the current architecture.

•

Balance and Tuning Issues:  As with any RPG system, there’s a chance that certain mechanics are

not   perfectly   balanced.   Perhaps   some   skill   or   power   system   could   allow   exploitative   behavior

(intentionally or not), or the difficulty of enemies doesn’t scale well at higher levels leading to either

steamrolls or impossibility. The liability here is that without extensive playtesting, some  pacing or

balance bugs  might only become apparent after many hours of gameplay. For example, maybe a

fast-paced profile combined with certain XP multipliers levels a character too quickly, skipping tiers

unexpectedly. The scaffolding gave a guideline (e.g. Fast 2/10 profile → 1000-1500 XP per session)
, but until we see it in action, we can’t be sure those numbers yield the desired experience. This is

80

a normal risk in RPG design – expect to fine-tune XP curves, enemy stat blocks, etc., once players

start really using the system.

•

Model Behavior Variance:  A subtle liability is that AIDM’s performance might vary with different

underlying   LLMs.   It   was   primarily   tested   on   a   certain   model   (Claude   or   GPT-4   variant).   Another

model,   even   if   it   has   the   context   length,   might   not   follow   the   instructions   as   reliably   or   might

interpret them differently. For instance, an open-source 100k model (when those exist) could have a

different style, causing more errors or less vibrant storytelling. The entire system hinges on the AI

adhering to the written modules – if a model decides to deviate or “creatively interpret” instructions,

there’s no hard enforcement (beyond the error checker). This is more of an AI alignment issue than

architecture, but it’s a risk that the same prompt might produce different quality outputs under

different AI models or settings. Mitigating this will require testing on multiple models and possibly

adding more reinforcement (like few-shot demonstrations of correct behavior) for less reliable LLMs.

Recommendations Before v3 Release

1.

Complete   and   Iterate   on   Acceptance   Testing:  The   highest   priority   is   to  run   and   pass   all   8

planned tests. Focus especially on the incomplete ones: Multi-Anime Fusion, Session Persistence,

Memory Coherence, Error Recovery, Genre Adaptation, and Research Validation. For each failing or

partial   case,   conduct   root-cause   analysis   and   update   the   respective   module   instructions   or   add

additional guidance. For example, if TEST-002 (fusion) fails due to contradictions, consider adding a

small   “fusion   resolution”   routine   in   Module   07   to   explicitly   reconcile   conflicts.   If   TEST-003

(persistence) finds any data not saving/loading, patch the state schema or export logic immediately.

14

Use the test scripts as a blueprint to harden the system where it’s weakest. This will likely yield a

handful   of   prompt   adjustments   (as   already   seen   with   the   Player   Agency   fixes   after   TEST-004)   –

implement   those   systematically   until   all   tests   are

.   Achieving   full   test   pass   will   greatly   increase

confidence in v2’s stability.

2.

Strengthen Genre Trope Integration: Ensure that narrative profiles fully leverage the genre trope

libraries.   Currently,   profiles   mention   tropes   qualitatively   but   don’t   automatically   pull   in   trope

structures. We recommend adding a “Genre Tropes Integration” section in each core profile (as

suggested   in   the   audit)   to   explicitly   reference   relevant   trope   templates

81

.   This   could   involve

instructions   like:   “When   running   a   Hunter   x   Hunter   campaign,   incorporate  shonen_tropes.md

training arc and tournament patterns, adjusted for Nen mechanics.” By making these links explicit in

profiles (and conversely maybe listing in trope files which profiles exemplify them), the AI will be

more likely to use them in play. This is a low-hanging fruit to improve narrative depth and ensure no

library content sits unused. It will also help Test-007 (genre adaptation) to pass by affirming that

each genre’s hallmark elements are present.

3.

Expand and Refine Content Coverage: Before v3, address the known gaps in content. This means

completing the trope libraries that were left skeletal (e.g. if Seinen or Sports tropes are sparse) and

adding   any   missing   anime   profiles   that   cover   major   genres   not   yet   represented   (e.g.   perhaps   a

Mecha anime profile, a Shoujo romance profile, etc., since those were noted as missing)

12

. Even if

v3 will focus on new features, having a broad content base in v2 ensures a better reception and

more testing data. Also consider adding more “reference implementations” for non-anime scenarios

if relevant (though the focus is anime, perhaps a few variations like a JRPG game world profile could

be   interesting).   Another   aspect   is   populating   the  mechanical   example   data  in   profiles:   some

profiles like Code Geass or Vinland Saga have complex needs (mecha combat, etc.) – verify their

scaffolding sections are as thorough as others. The Priority 1 scaffolding update added a lot of this

content; now do a pass for consistency and completeness across all profiles. Essentially, ship v2 with

the   richest   and   most   polished   set   of   profiles/tropes   possible,   so   that   v3   can   focus   on   new

systems rather than backfilling basics.

4.

Fine-Tune Balance and Pacing  (Iterative Tuning): Using the results of long-form test runs or beta

players, adjust the numeric parameters for combat and progression. For example, if players report

leveling is too slow in practice, tweak the XP curves; if certain abilities are overpowered or trivialize

combat,   adjust   their   costs   or   effects.   This   may   involve   updating   the   tables   in
leveling_curves.md ,   stat_frameworks.md ,   or   the   default   enemy   stats   in   trope   files.   Pay

attention to the  tier transitions  (like the pivots at Tier 3 and Tier 5 in power scaling) – ensure the

narrative   pivot   feels   earned   and   not   abrupt.   Also   verify   resource   management   is   neither   too

punishing nor too lenient (the tests check resource tracking, but not the feel of scarcity/abundance).

Essentially,   treat   AIDM   like   a   game   undergoing   balance   testing:   gather   feedback,   identify   pain

points, and iterate. Even small prompt tweaks (e.g. adjusting an HP formula or an XP multiplier) can

significantly improve the gameplay experience. This tuning should ideally be done before v3 if v3 will

layer new features on top – we want a solid baseline so new features don’t have to fix old balance

issues.

5.

Enhance Error Recovery & AI Self-Awareness: Although the Error Recovery module exists, consider

bolstering it with more examples or rules for common failure modes observed during testing. For

instance,  if  the  AI  tends  to  occasionally  forget  to  deduct  resources  or  misnames  an  NPC,  add  a

15

specific check or example for that case (some of these are in TEST-006). Also, implement a logging or

debugging aid – even if just in documentation – to help future developers trace what went wrong

when   the   AI   misbehaves.   Perhaps   a   hidden   “debug   mode”   prompt   could   be   included   that   a

developer can activate to have the AI explain its reasoning or which modules it’s invoking (this would

be for internal use, not normal play). Furthermore, given model variability, instill a bit more  self-

monitoring in the AI’s instructions: e.g. remind it at the end of each turn to verify key state metrics

(HP never below 0 without death event, inventory counts match, etc.). This is partially done, but

doubling down will reduce the chance of errors slipping through. Essentially, aim for AIDM to be self-

correcting as much as possible, since that makes it resilient even outside the tested scenarios.

6.

Prepare for Multi-User and Multi-Agent Possibilities: While not a v2 requirement, if v3 or later will

explore   multi-player   or   multi-agent,   it’s   wise   to   design   with   that   in   mind   now.   This   could   mean

structuring   the   prompt   to   easily   accommodate   multiple   player   characters   (perhaps   have   the

cognitive engine identify which player spoke if a prefix or ID is given) and maintaining separate

memory   tracks   for   each   if   needed.   For   multi-agent,   one   idea   is   to   allow   certain   modules   to   be

toggled off if an external agent is handling them – for example, if a separate NPC-AI is managing
NPC dialogue, Module 04 could be disabled or run in a minimal mode. Laying groundwork like a

clear   interface   for   modules   (what   input/output   each   expects)   could   ease   future   distribution.

Although   this   isn’t   an   immediate   need,   making   the   system   more  agnostic   to   number   of

participants will future-proof it. At minimum, document how one would integrate another agent or

player, so it’s easier to implement down the line.

7.

Improve Documentation & Community Guides: As the system opens up to users and contributors,

ensure the documentation is exhaustive and accessible. Create a “Game Master’s Guide” for AIDM

that explains to a user (perhaps one not involved in development) how to set up the game, what

each module does in plain language, and how to interpret the AI’s output. Some of this exists in

README and docs, but it can be consolidated into a polished guide for the release. Also, provide

guidance for modders: e.g. a short tutorial on “How to create a new Narrative Profile file” or “How to

add a new trope library,” including the do’s and don’ts (follow the schema format, keep descriptions

concise, etc.). The easier we make it for the community to contribute correctly, the more content will

flow in. Additionally, maintain an updated  architecture diagram or data flow chart  (the one in
ARCHITECTURE.md  is great

) as a quick reference. Clear and inviting documentation will lower

82

the technical barrier and also reduce the risk of someone introducing errors through misguided

mods.

8.

Introduce   a   Safety/Ethics   Layer   (if   applicable):  If   not   already   planned   for   v3,   consider   adding

some   form   of  content   safety   or   “Constitutional   AI”   rules  sooner   rather   than   later.   RPGs   can

venture into sensitive content; while player preference calibration covers things like violence/gore, it

might be wise to have a backstop for truly objectionable content. The roadmap’s Phase 2 mentions a

constitutional AI framework

83

. If time permits, drafting a minimal set of ethical guidelines for the

AI   DM   (e.g.   lines   it   should   not   cross,   how   to   handle   potentially   offensive   player   requests)   could

prevent   bad   outcomes.   Even   a   simple   filter   that   the   Error   Recovery   could   trigger   (“if   the   AI

inadvertently   produces   disallowed   content,   apologize   and   steer   away”)   would   be   beneficial.   This

reduces liability and makes the system more robust in a public setting. It’s understandable if this is

beyond   v2   scope,   but   it’s   a   recommendation   to   keep   high   on   the   list,   especially   as   community

content comes in (since not everyone will adhere to the same content standards).

16

In   conclusion,   AIDM   v2   is   a   remarkably   comprehensive   and   well-architected   system   for   AI-driven   RPG

mastering, having addressed most of its early weaknesses through rigorous audits. By executing the above

recommendations – solidifying test-proven stability, tightening integration loose ends, expanding content,

and  preparing  for  future  growth  –  the  team  can  ensure  that  v2  is  not  just  a  proof-of-concept,  but  a

production-ready   foundation  for   the   ambitious   features   planned   in   v3   and   beyond.   With   these

improvements, AIDM will be well-positioned as a durable, extensible platform for dynamic anime-inspired

storytelling, backed by a robust architectural core.
