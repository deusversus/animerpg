Phase 7 Audit – AIDM v2 Performance, Footprint &

Scalability

1. Instructional Overhead and Module Loading

AIDM v2 consists of 14 modular instruction files (Modules 00–13) plus two master files (loader and core

instructions)

1

2

.   Originally,   these   modules   totaled   over   142k   tokens   (pre-optimization)   –   a   massive

prompt overhead

3

. After aggressive compression (62% reduction), the modules now sum to ~54k tokens

3

4

. Token distribution is uneven: some modules remain large (e.g.  Module 07: Anime Integration

~14,767 tokens post-opt) while others are lightweight (e.g. Module 08: Combat ~2,069 tokens)

5

.

Load Strategy:  The system avoids dumping all modules at once.  Tiered lazy-loading  is used: a minimal

core   set   loads   initially,   and   specialized   modules   only   load   upon   relevant   triggers

6

7

.   For   example,

Tier 1  always loads critical engines (00, 01, 02, 03, 10, 11, 12) while  Tier 2  modules (NPC AI, Narrative

systems, Session Zero, Anime integration, Combat, etc.) load “on intent” – only when their functionality is

needed

8

9

. This keeps the active prompt size lean. In fact, the AIDM core instructions note that active

context is kept around 20–30K tokens by selective loading, with library indices pre-loaded (≈6.4K tokens) for
. Optional content (specific trope libraries, profile files) is pulled in only if/when the campaign
navigation

10

calls for it

11

. The loader even defines an unloading rule: if token usage exceeds ~80% of context, unused

Tier 2 modules are dropped to free space

12

. This dynamic loading architecture is effective – it prevents

initial prompt bloat and defers large text until necessary, reducing overhead by “40–60% token savings” vs.

naive loading

13

.

Reusability  vs.  Repetition:  The  modular  design  minimizes  redundant  text.  Each  file  has  a  distinct  role

(cognitive engine, state manager, combat rules, etc.), and cross-references others instead of duplicating

logic

14

15

. For example, the Core Instructions direct the LLM to  consult specific modules  for particular

tasks (e.g. consult Module 04 for dialogue/NPC behavior, Module 08 for combat, Module 13 for narrative

tone) rather than each module restating those rules

14

16

. This reuse ensures instructions aren’t copy-

pasted across modules. However, tight coupling is present: many modules depend on outputs of others

(e.g. Narrative Calibration (Mod 13) relies on Anime Integration (Mod 07) and Narrative Systems (Mod 05)

data

17

). Such cross-module references mean the prompt can swell if multiple linked modules must be in

context together. The team identified some overlapping responsibilities during integration (e.g. between

Player Agency rules in Mod 12 and narrative scaffolding in Mod 13) and resolved redundancies

18

19

.

Overall, the instruction set is highly optimized in content and loading strategy, but its sheer breadth (~87K

tokens total including schemas

4

) means careful management is required to fit within context limits.

2. Schema Weight and State Complexity

The AIDM defines 8 JSON schemas for game state (character, world, NPC, memory threads, etc.), which add

significant   token   load   and   runtime   complexity

1

20

.   Unlike   markdown   instructions,   JSON   doesn’t

compress well; the schemas alone constitute ~33K tokens (post-optimization)

21

 due to syntax overhead.

1

Each schema is richly nested. For example, the  NPC schema  has multiple layers of detail – core identity

(name, appearance, personality traits, secrets), knowledge, behavior patterns, relationships, etc.

22

23

  –

capturing nearly every facet of an NPC. Similarly, the  world_state  likely tracks time, locations, factions,

events,   and   global   variables,   while  memory_thread  entries   contain   structured   memory   records.   Deep

nesting and numerous fields mean the runtime JSON state can become “bloated” as the campaign grows:

every new NPC, quest, or world event adds to the state object. The system is explicitly designed to avoid

uncontrolled growth: “Single source of truth” rules ensure data isn’t duplicated across schemas (e.g. an NPC’s

affinity appears only in the NPC schema, not redundantly in character schema)

24

. This prevents inflation

by   redundancy.   Still,   the   interconnected   nature   of   state   means   one   change   cascades   through   many

structures   –   e.g.   an  NPC   death  triggers   updates   in   npc_schema   (mark   dead),   character_schema

(relationships, quest status), world_state (faction power shifts, event log), and a new memory thread for the

event

25

. This level of detail, while ensuring consistency, means the state can grow large and must be kept

consistent across subsystems.

Risk of Bloated Runtime State: Without constraints, long games could accumulate hundreds of memory

threads, dozens of NPCs, and an expanding history of world events. The  memory_thread_schema  allows
, which could lead to hundreds of
unlimited threads categorized by type (core, relationships, quests, etc.)

26

entries if every small event were remembered. The designers mitigate this by  aggressive pruning and

summarization policies. The Learning Engine monitors memory size and  triggers compression when a

category exceeds ~100 threads or threads age beyond 5 sessions with low “heat”

27

. Compression

merges multiple low-importance memories into a summarized thread (3–10 events combined) and archives

the originals

28

. This reduces state bulk while preserving key points. The compression rules explicitly forbid

touching critical memories (core or plot-crucial) and recent events

29

, ensuring only stale, minor details are

pruned. Similarly, completed quests get “heavily summarized after 5+ sessions”

30

.

State Saving/Streaming:  The  Session Export  process also helps manage long-term state size. When the

player saves, the State Manager assembles the full state JSON and compresses trivial or distant elements

(e.g. low-heat memories, long-past events, finished quests) before output

31

. This prevents the save file

(and subsequent prompt re-load) from ballooning with irrelevant detail. The saved JSON includes metadata

like version, session count, etc., and even a checksum for integrity

32

. While the documentation doesn’t

explicitly mention “streaming” large state (e.g. outputting it in chunks), the emphasis on compress-then-

export suggests the system aims to keep the final blob manageable for the model to output in one go. If an

export ever did exceed the model’s output limit, the likely recourse would be manually splitting it up, but

ideally the pre-save compression avoids that scenario. On load, the system can parse the JSON in sections

(character, world, NPC arrays, etc.) since the schema partitions the data, which is a form of chunking for

reconstruction (each part validated separately)

31

33

. In short, the schemas are heavy, but the framework

actively curbs uncontrolled growth via summarization and by only keeping salient state details “hot.”

3. Memory Management and Long-Term Play

Memory Threads Evolution: AIDM’s memory system is built for indefinite campaigns by categorizing and

aging memories. Each memory thread has a  “heat index”  that rises with recent or important references

and decays over time

34

. During long play, the memory_thread entries for key ongoing topics remain hot

and loaded, whereas older, resolved, or less relevant threads cool off and eventually compress. For example,

Core memories (fundamental world rules, character backstory) never decay at all – they are permanent with

base   heat   100

35

36

.   But  Consequences  or   ephemeral   events   have   fast   decay   and   will   fade   to   the

background quickly if not relevant

37

. By using category-specific decay rates (slow for relationships, fast for

2

trivial consequences, none for core)

34

38

, the system simulates  memory loss  for unimportant details.

This prevents the context from being cluttered with every minor thing that happened 10 sessions ago. The

system can “forget” or summarize such details unless they become relevant again.

Compression & Pruning: As noted, the Learning Engine automatically summarizes old memories. When

compression triggers (low heat, older than 5 sessions), the engine  combines multiple threads into one

summary thread

28

. The original threads are archived or marked as compressed, and any important bits

(like an NPC relationship turning point) are retained in the summary note

39

. These summaries drastically

cut   down   memory   volume   while   keeping   the   narrative   continuity:   e.g.   rather   than   10   separate   threads

about small talk with an NPC, the system might keep one “You spent several uneventful evenings with X

over the summer” entry. The  Memory Creation rules also avoid bloat: AIDM only creates a new memory

thread for significant events (victory, meeting a major NPC, plot twists, permanent changes) and explicitly

does not log trivial actions or repetitive grind

40

41

. This disciplined approach curtails the growth rate of

memory entries.

Decay Models & Forgetting:  The heat index implements a  decay model  per session tick: for example, a

memory with “normal” decay loses 5 heat each session of inactivity

34

. Once its heat falls below active

thresholds,   it   effectively   “falls   out”   of   the   running   context   unless   specifically   prompted.   This   mimics

forgetting. Some memories (like  player-established facts or core canon) have  no decay  (heat fixed)

42

36

, so the system never loses them – a crucial design to prevent lore contradictions. Others decaying to

near zero become archived – they remain in the saved state but would only be reloaded if explicitly needed.

The   system   also   supports  manual   memory   curation:   the   player   can   say   “Remember   this”   to   flag

something as permanently important (making it a high-heat, non-decaying thread)

43

, or conversely could

instruct forgetting if desired (not a standard command, but the DM could choose to drop a thread). Also,

memories   can   conflict   or   be   overridden:   the  Memory   Conflict   Resolution  policy   says   if   a   new   player-

established fact contradicts older info, the older memory is updated or noted as retconned

44

. They even

allow a full retcon (“retroactive continuity”) via discussion – if the player wants to rewrite history, the rule is

essentially to start a new campaign or branch storyline rather than corrupt core memories

36

45

. This

shows a structured approach to overrides: core truths aren’t casually changed mid-run; a true retcon is

treated as a major event (or new timeline). Minor inconsistencies or player mis-rememberings are handled

in-play by politely correcting the player using the memory logs

46

.

Long-Form State Persistence:  The system is explicitly designed to carry a campaign through unlimited

sessions   via   exports.   Each   save   includes   all   memory   threads,   but   thanks   to   compression,   a   years-long

campaign’s save file should contain a lot of distilled summaries rather than every chat line. Importantly, the

session export format is versioned and backward-compatible. The state JSON has a version tag, and the

State Manager will detect older version saves and  migrate them to the latest schema on load
. For
example, a v1.5 save with a single “health” field would be converted into the new v2.0   resources.hp

47

structure automatically on import

47

. This versioning support ensures that even as AIDM’s schemas evolve

(v2.1, v3.0, etc.), long-term players won’t lose their progress – their old saves can be upgraded to the new

format. Overall, memory and state are managed with a clear eye toward long-session sustainability: the

combination of selective memory retention, periodic compression, and version-aware saving/loading allows

multi-session (even multi-year) campaigns to continue without overflowing the context window or breaking

consistency.

4. Runtime Token Pressure & Context Window Management

AIDM v2 is optimized to work within the constraints of large-context LLMs (targeting up to 100k-200k token

48

contexts)
context   window

. The full system (all core modules + schemas) is ~87k tokens, which is about 43% of a 200k
.   Obviously,   not   every   model   or   scenario   can   handle   that   at   once   –   so   the   runtime

4

strategy is to keep the active prompt far below the max. As mentioned, only relevant portions are kept in

context at any given time. In typical gameplay, the prompt will include: the core Tier-1 instructions (perhaps

~25-30k tokens)

49

10

, a few Tier-2 modules if currently needed (each a few thousand tokens), the two

small index files (~6.3k tokens total)

10

, and the current game state (which might be on the order of a few

thousand tokens if tightly managed). This likely falls in the ~30k–40k token range during normal play –

within   a   32k   model’s   limit.   The   system   explicitly   notes  “lazy-loading   architecture   loads   only   20-30K   active

tokens”  by   deferring   libraries   until   needed

10

.   It   also   advises   adding   optional   instructions  “only   when

needed (progressive loading)” to control complexity

50

.

Techniques  to  Stay  Within  Context:  Several   techniques   are   employed:   -  Lazy   Loading:  Most   modules

(especially content-heavy ones like combat, progression, anime research) are loaded on-demand and can be

unloaded when not in use

12

. For example, if the campaign is currently social and narrative, the combat

module might be dropped from the prompt entirely, freeing space, and only reintroduced when a fight is

imminent. -  Index & Library system:  Instead of front-loading all lore and trope data, the system uses

concise index files (under 1.5k words each after optimization

51

) to allow lookup of which detailed library

to load

11

. During character creation (Session Zero), only 1–3 specific profile files and trope files are loaded

based on the player’s choices

11

. The rest remain out of context. This drastically cuts token usage – e.g. the

entire narrative profiles library is ~180k tokens if all 20 profiles loaded

52

, but a single campaign might

load only a couple profiles relevant to the chosen genre, maybe 5-10% of that. - Memory Constraints: The

system uses memory heat to  limit how many memory entries stay in context. Only high-heat recent

memories   and   core   facts   are   kept   “ACTIVE   (hot)”   in   the   prompt

53

.   Older   ones   move   to   “WARM”   or

“COOL” (not in the immediate context unless triggered)

53

. This ensures the conversation history doesn’t

snowball. If the context window is at risk of overflow (e.g. after a very long scene with many details), the

engine   can   compress   and   archive   some   memories   to   make   room .   There’s   also   an   emphasis   on

27

exporting state after major story arcs

50

. This is essentially a strategy to clear the conversational context

– by saving and possibly restarting with a fresh prompt plus imported state, the running context window is

reset. The architecture guide suggests doing an export after big milestones to avoid losing information

when the context window starts to saturate

50

. In practice, a user might play 50k tokens worth of story,

then the system says “let’s save and continue in a new session,” ensuring the next session starts again with

the essential state but without carrying the entire past dialogue in the token buffer.

Max Capacity vs. Model Limits: On a 32k-token model, AIDM is at the razor’s edge – it can function, but

only by strictly limiting active content. The design to hover around ~30k active tokens

10

  is deliberate to

support 32k models, but if a user tried to “turn everything on” (load all modules and libraries at once), it

would far exceed 32k. For instance, loading multiple big trope files together or having an enormous world

state with dozens of NPCs would blow past the limit. The system mitigates this by rarely needing all features

simultaneously (you wouldn’t normally load  every  genre library – you pick a genre or two). Still, complex

scenarios must be managed carefully on 32k contexts. By contrast, on a  100k-token model, AIDM has

breathing   room.   It   could   support   many   more   concurrent   elements   –   possibly   running   a   full   end-game

scenario with combat, progression, multiple active NPCs, and a large memory without truncation. The total

size of all modules+schemas (~87k) fits within 100k

4

, so in theory a 100k model could even load the

entire system state at once. However, adding a lot of libraries or extremely large states could approach even

4

that limit. For example, if a campaign somehow loaded 5 different power system libraries and 5 genre trope

files (each library being thousands of lines long

54

55

), it could easily add tens of thousands of tokens. The

AIDM team’s expectation is that only a subset is ever needed concurrently. They achieved an  optimized

base of ~45k tokens (as initially estimated) for core content, ~22% of a 200k window

48

, leaving headroom

for dynamic content. With corrected calculations, the base is nearer 87k (43% of 200k)

4

, but the same

principle applies: the remaining context is allocated to whatever ephemeral content is relevant  right now

(current conversation turn, current scene details, etc.). In summary, AIDM employs every trick – modular

prompts,   chunking   content,   compressing   memories   –   to   manage   context,   and   explicitly   warns   when

approaching   limits   (the   80%   threshold   rule)   so   it   can   shed   load   proactively

12

.   This   makes   it   viable   to

maintain coherence even in very long sessions, as long as one periodically saves and prunes.

5. Scalability with System Complexity

AIDM v2 is ambitious in scope – it’s built to handle multifaceted worlds blending multiple anime settings,

numerous NPCs, complex mechanics, and evolving narratives. The architecture supports scalability up to a

point, but there are practical limits dictated by consistency and context size.

•

Multiverse & Multiple Timelines:  The system can integrate multiple fictional universes into one

campaign (a key feature is  “fuses multiple anime into coherent, playable worlds”

56

). This is done by

harmonizing their power systems and tropes via the Anime Integration module

57

58

. In other

words, if you say “I want Naruto + Solo Leveling + My Hero Academia combined,” the AIDM will

research each and blend them. This effectively creates a “multiverse” style setting inside one world

state. There isn’t an explicit notion of running two separate worlds in parallel with separate states

(like   two   campaigns   at   once   in   one   session)   –   the   design   assumes   one   active   world   at   a   time.

However,   the   world_state_schema   could   theoretically   be   extended   to   have   multiple   realms   or

dimensions listed. That said, each additional world or timeline would expand the state and require

the AI to maintain consistency across them, which would be challenging if done concurrently. The

safer path is treating a jump to an alternate timeline as part of the narrative of one campaign (still

one   state,   just   more   content).   The   system   can   handle   this   narratively   (since   world   events   and

memory threads can record dimension hops), but if one tried to literally double the scope (two full

worlds worth of data), token pressure and complexity might double as well. So  multiverse play is

supported conceptually, but in practice likely limited by the same context constraints discussed – it’s

feasible to include a few parallel threads (e.g. an alternate future arc) as long as the combined data

stays within memory budgets.

•

NPCs and Quests Volume: The NPC management system is robust – each NPC has an entry with

personal data and the NPC Intelligence module tracks relationships, affinity scores (-100 to +100),

secrets,   schedules,   etc.

59

60

.   This   means   the   game   can   support   a   living   world   with   many

characters. However, each active NPC does add overhead: not only the data stored for them, but also

memory   threads   for   interactions   and   potential   dialogue   context.   How   many   NPCs   can   be   active

“without degrading consistency”? Likely on the order of dozens, not hundreds. The memory system

keeps only important NPC memories hot, and will summarize older interactions

38

27

, which helps

as the cast grows. But if you had, say, 50 significant NPCs all in the current storyline, keeping track of

all  their  personalities  and  relationships  could  strain  the  model’s  consistency.  The  system  tries  to

mitigate this by  information retrieval triggers  – when an NPC comes on stage, it will load that

NPC’s relevant memory threads and profile, but it won’t try to keep all 50 NPCs’ details in context at

once

61

. Essentially it does a context-sensitive fetch: “NPC encountered → load relationship memories

5

[for that NPC]”

61

. This means you can have a large world of characters, but only the ones presently

involved are fully loaded. As long as the campaign’s scope in any given scene is limited (e.g. you’re

not having 20 NPCs all converse simultaneously), consistency remains high. If too many appear at

once, the AI might start to confuse or simplify them, as it can’t realistically hold detailed nuances of

dozens of personalities simultaneously in a 32k window. The same logic applies to quests: the Quest

log (likely part of character or world state) can hold many ongoing quests, but AIDM will keep focus

on the active ones. Completed or long-dormant quests get fast decay and heavy compression

30

,

preventing the quest list from endlessly growing in prompt. We can infer the system could juggle on

the order of 5–10 active quests comfortably. Beyond that, it might need to offload or summarize

some (“archive” lesser side-quests until reactivated).

•

Blended Profiles and Power Systems: AIDM was designed to be extensible with new mechanics

and   narrative   layers.   It   comes   with   libraries   covering   15   genre   trope   sets   and   5   major   power

system types, and a unified stat framework

54

55

. It’s explicitly prepared to integrate new content:

the Narrative Calibration module (Mod 13) can take any anime narrative “DNA” and map it onto the

. The practical limit here is again token space and coherence. If
mechanics via these libraries
a campaign tries to enable every power system at once (mana + ki + psionics + tech + etc.), the model

63

62

must reference multiple library files and schemas simultaneously. This is doable (the power systems

are   actually   meant   to   be   mixed   –   e.g.   a   character   could   have   both   magic   and   ki   abilities   in   a

crossover world), but each added system increases state complexity (e.g. tracking both MP and a chi

energy, multiple skill sets, etc.). The  Power System schema  is generic enough to define various

energy resources and abilities

64

, and the system can certainly scale to a complex character with

multi-power capabilities. The caution is that every extra mechanic means more rules to follow, which

can tax the LLM’s consistency. AIDM tries to keep mechanics unified (e.g. everything funnels into HP/

MP/SP for simplicity

65

). So while extending with new mechanics is supported, there’s an upper

bound where too many parallel subsystems could confuse the model or cause it to hit context limits.

The  developers likely targeted ~95% coverage of popular anime  with the provided libraries

66

67

. Adding niche genres beyond that is possible but each addition adds weight.

In summary, AIDM’s design scales well across different axes (NPC count, quest count, multiple genre fusion)

through careful data management and modular activation. The primary scaling limit is the context window

and cognitive load on the LLM. As the number of simultaneous active elements grows, maintaining strict

consistency   and   rich   detail   for   all   of   them   becomes   harder.   The   system   mitigates   this   with   focus   –   by

concentrating on one world/timeline at a time, a manageable subset of NPCs at a time, one or two genre

profiles at a time, etc. If one attempted to push beyond these (e.g. run two separate parties in two different

regions concurrently, each with their own subplots, within one session), the lack of clear boundaries could

strain coherence. However, AIDM would likely handle it by treating each as separate “scenes” and swapping

context (somewhat like a GM cutting between groups), which again relies on the memory system to recall

the right info at the right moment. Thus the architecture is flexible and extensible, but not infinite – there is

a point where more complexity yields diminishing returns in consistency. The designers seem aware of this,

hence the emphasis on modular optional content and not forcing everything to be active at once.

6

6. Resilience and Failure Modes

AIDM v2 has been built with a  “fail gracefully”  philosophy in mind

68

, aiming for resilience if things go

wrong. Several mechanisms handle potential failure modes:

•

Token   Limit   Exceeded:  If   the   prompt   assembly   ever   risks   exceeding   the   model’s   context,   AIDM

employs fallback measures. As noted, when usage goes above ~80% capacity, it will unload non-

essential modules automatically

12

. This prevents hard failures (e.g. the model truncating important

instructions).  In  practice,  if  the  story  suddenly  requires  many  systems  (say  a  combat  with  heavy

narrative and an active research segment simultaneously), the DM could temporarily drop or shorten

some content (like skip verbose trope descriptions) to stay under limit. Additionally, the  Memory

compression  kicks in to shrink the prompt when it grows too large (removing low-heat memories

proactively)

27

. If despite these efforts the context window is exceeded (e.g. on a smaller model),

the likely failure mode is the model starting to lose earlier instructions. The system tries to guard

against this by periodically re-checking that core instructions are followed (for example, Rule 1 of the

core instructions:  “Check instructions before  every  reply”

14

, meaning the model should constantly

refer back to the loaded rules). But if some instructions have scrolled out of context, the model

might   violate   them   inadvertently.   The  Error   Recovery  module   (Mod   10)   and   Player   Agency

enforcement (Mod 12) act as sentinels for such behavior – if the model output starts to go off rules,

these modules detect it and intervene. For instance, if due to lost context the model tries to make a

decision for the player, the Player Agency logic will catch the pattern and issue an emergency stop/

correction

69

. In essence, the system has internal alarms for symptoms of instruction loss or drift.

•

Module/Schema Load Failures: If a required file is missing or fails to load correctly, AIDM will not

continue blindly. During initialization, it validates that all 8 required schemas are present

70

 – if

any schema is absent or invalid, the system  halts startup with an error  (“AIDM CANNOT START

WITHOUT REQUIRED SCHEMAS”)

71

. This is a hard failure, but a deliberate one to avoid running in a

corrupt state. Similarly, critical Tier-1 modules must load successfully; if one of them were missing,

the   system   likely   wouldn’t   proceed   (the   loader   script   has   them   all   marked   critical).   For   Tier-2

modules,   the   design   allows  graceful   degradation.   Module   00’s   health   check   classifies   systems   as

critical,   important,   or   optional:   if   an   optional   module   fails   to   load   or   crashes,   AIDM   declares   a

“degraded mode” where that feature is turned off, but the game continues without it

72

73

. For

example,   if   the   NPC   Intelligence   module   (04)   encountered   an   error   or   was   too   large   to   keep   in

context, AIDM could continue but NPC behaviors would revert to simpler logic (lacking the advanced

social AI). It explicitly states Tier-2 failures result in “[system] OFFLINE” but gameplay can go on in a

limited capacity

73

. This prevents total collapse of the session; the player might receive a notice that

e.g. “Advanced combat is offline, using basic narration instead” if the combat module fails.

•

Context Expiry (Long Sessions): In extremely long single sessions (approaching the model’s token

limit in continuous conversation), there is a risk that early instructions (loaded at session start) expire

from   the   context   memory.   AIDM’s   recommended   approach   to   long   campaigns   is  session

segmentation – encouraging saves and new session starts periodically

50

. By exporting state and

reloading it in a fresh conversation (with the instructions re-uploaded), they avoid ever truly hitting a

point where context is exhausted. If a user didn’t do this and just kept one chat going past the

window, eventually the model would start forgetting earlier parts (initial system prompts, etc.). The

AIDM   devs   mitigate   this   by   making   the   instructions   a   persistent   frame   of   reference:   the   LLM   is

instructed to always refer back to them . So even if some have scrolled out, the model might

14

7

regenerate   their   essence   from   memory   for   a   while.   Nonetheless,   eventually   physics   wins   and   it

would degrade. This is why the  Continue Guide  suggests a base token budget and implies using
CONTINUE_HERE.md   or similar to restart sessions safely

. The system is resilient in that it

74

75

plans for long campaigns via state hand-off rather than truly infinite context streaming.

•

Graceful Error Handling:  AIDM is proactive about catching errors in outputs and state. The  Error

Recovery (Mod 10) continuously validates the consistency of the game state after each action – e.g.

it will check that HP never goes negative, that inventory changes make sense, that timeline events

don’t contradict each other

25

. If it detects an anomaly (like an impossible outcome or a missed

rule),  it  triggers  a  correction  routine.  This  might  involve  the  DM  module  narrating  a  retcon  (“An

inconsistency was detected and corrected”) or offering the player choices to resolve it. The system’s

logs   show   an   example   where   an  agency   violation  (the   DM   auto-resolving   a   player   choice)   was

caught   in   testing

76

.   The   fix   was   to   implement   a  “mandatory   hard   stop”  anytime   the   model

presents a decision – i.e. forcibly prevent it from narrating past a choice without player input

77

69

.

This kind of runtime check and override indicates a resilient behavior: the model can interrupt its

own narrative if it realizes a critical rule is being broken, apologize, and rewind

78

. That avoids a

failure where the story runs off the rails; instead, the system self-corrects to uphold design principles

(player agency in this case).

•

Schema and Loader Brittleness:  With so many interdependent files, there is risk of  “dependency

drift”  –   e.g.   one   module   expecting   a   field   that   the   schema   or   another   module   changed.   The

development process included integration audits to catch these mismatches

18

. For instance, after

adding the narrative calibration module, they found some redundancy with player agency rules and

that genre trope files weren’t auto-loading when expected

79

80

. These were fixed by updating the

relevant modules (e.g. integrating Module 12’s checks into Module 01’s flow, and adding auto-load

triggers in Module 13 for certain campaign types)

81

82

. This shows that while the architecture can

be   brittle   if   pieces   don’t   line   up,   the   team   built   in  cross-references   and   audits  to   maintain

alignment. Each module clearly lists its dependencies

83

, and the initialization explicitly loads in a

set order to satisfy them (e.g. cognitive engine before any others that rely on intent parsing)

84

. If a

version mismatch occurs (say an older save with an outdated field), the Version Migration handles it

gracefully as mentioned, rather than crashing on a schema validation

47

.

In failure scenarios that can’t be auto-resolved, AIDM errs on the side of safety. It will halt the game rather

than generate nonsense. For example, if an essential research (from Anime Integration) can’t be done due to

no   internet   or   missing   info,   AIDM   has  “ABORT   mechanisms”  to   stop   and   inform   the   user   instead   of

hallucinating

85

. This is a deliberate safe-fail: the game master will say “I cannot proceed without that

data” (perhaps prompting the user to provide it or try again later) rather than making something up. This

preserves the integrity of the experience at the cost of interrupting it – a preferable outcome to a lore-

breaking hallucination.

Bottlenecks and Stability: The architecture’s complexity means the primary points of brittleness are at

integration boundaries. The team’s internal testing revealed issues like modules not fully enforcing each

other’s assumptions (e.g. the cognitive engine needed extra checks to enforce player agency)

86

. With

those   patches   in   place,   the   system   is   fairly   robust.   One   can   imagine   edge   cases   that   might   still   pose

problems – e.g. extremely large battles with hundreds of combatants might overwhelm combat tracking, or

a player that purposefully pushes the system by invoking obscure combinations of mechanics might find an

unhandled gap. However, the presence of the Error Recovery module provides a net: if something truly

8

bizarre happens, the system will attempt a controlled shutdown or reset of that aspect (for example, an

“Emergency Recovery”  scenario in Module 00 describes halting and rewinding to last valid state if a critical

error occurs

87

). This ensures the game doesn’t continue on a corrupted state. The loader and initialization

also   have   contingencies   for   partial   availability   –   e.g.   a  “Limited   Mode”  prompt   if   some   schemas   are

missing, warning the user that certain systems will be inactive if they proceed

88

.

In   conclusion,   AIDM   v2   exhibits   strong   resilience   through  preventative   design  (lazy   loading,   token

budgeting),  active   monitoring  (heat   index,   validation   checks),   and  failsafe   behaviors  (degraded   mode,

emergency   stops,   version   migration).   While   no   system   relying   on   LLM   context   is   100%   foolproof   (the

underlying model could always produce an off-the-wall error), AIDM is engineered to catch and correct the

most   likely   failure   modes,   maintaining   a   stable   long-term   gameplay   experience.   It   prioritizes  graceful

degradation  over   collapse   –   simplifying   or   pausing   the   game   if   needed,   rather   than   allowing   silent

corruption – which is critical for sustaining narrative consistency in long sessions
