Module Interoperability

The AIDM v2 system is explicitly  modular  – each instruction module has a well-defined role and declared

dependencies   on   others.   Documentation   shows   a   clear   dependency   graph:   for   example,   the  NPC

Intelligence module (04) requires the Cognitive and Learning Engines and State Manager, while Narrative

Systems (05) depends on all prior modules

1

. This indicates core modules 00–03 (Initialization, Cognitive,

Learning, State) indeed serve as the backbone for higher-level functions. The design philosophy emphasizes

that modules operate independently and communicate via standardized interfaces (shared schemas, state

data)

2

. In practice, the initialization script enforces loading in dependency order – e.g. Cognitive (01)

before Learning (02), etc. – to prevent any module from running without its prerequisites

3

. The  loader

sequence  is structured accordingly: Tier-1 always loads critical core modules first (00–03, plus essential

cross-cutting modules like Error Recovery and Player Agency) before any optional or scenario-specific ones

4

.   Both   the   core   instructions   and   the   AIDM   loader   file   reflect   this   layered   approach   to   maintain

consistency.   Notably,   the   system   warns   that   loading   out-of-order   (say,   Narrative   before   Cognitive)   is   a

“dependency failure”

3

, underscoring that inter-module contracts must be respected. Overall, coupling

is minimized by having each module focus on a distinct domain (intent analysis, memory, state, etc.) and

share data only through the unified game state or memory threads. This means modifying a core module

could   impact   others   (since   many   build   on   the   core),   but   those   relationships   are   documented   and

constrained to defined interfaces rather than ad-hoc linkages. The use of JSON schemas (see below) as

common data contracts further decouples modules – changes must adhere to schema, which acts as a

stable interface. In summary,  module interoperability is high: dependencies are clear and deliberately

ordered, core engines provide services that later modules call upon, and the loader/initialization process

ensures the system’s cohesion from startup onward

4

3

. The main risk is if a fundamental module’s

behavior changes, multiple dependent modules might all need updates; however, the structured layering

and explicit dependency documentation mitigate the chances of unintended breakages.

Instruction & Schema Binding

Each instruction module is tightly bound to the relevant  JSON schema  that defines the data it manages,

ensuring consistency between the narrative rules and the stored state. For example, the Learning Engine

(Module 02) manages hierarchical memories and explicitly stores them as  “memory threads”  following the

Memory Thread Schema

5

. Similarly, the NPC Intelligence module always loads and updates NPC data

using the NPC Schema structure
 – it even notes that any significant NPC should be represented with a
full   npc_schema.json   entry   for   proper   affinity   tracking   and   persistence.   These   schemas   provide   a

6

contract of what fields exist (HP, MP, affinity, etc.), and the instructions reference them by name, preventing
mismatch. For instance, the NPC schema defines an  affinity  field ranging –100 to +100 for relationships

7

,   and   the   NPC   module   uses   that   exact   scale   in   its   affinity   system   logic   (hostile/unfriendly/neutral/

friendly/trusted/devoted thresholds)

8

. This alignment ensures the module’s expectations (e.g. that every

NPC   relationship   has   an   affinity   integer   in   that   range)   are   met   by   the   data   structure.   We   see   similar
  character_schema.json   and
mapping   in   other   areas:   the  State   Manager
world_state_schema.json  to update HP/MP, inventory, time, etc., and the Anime Integration module
populates  anime_world_schema.json  and  power_system_schema.json  when bringing in new world

(03)   uses

elements

9

. Because instructions always “consult” the schemas for reads/writes, there is a low risk of a

field being assumed that doesn’t exist – any new mechanic would require adding it to the schema first.

1

State consistency across components is strongly enforced. All modules share a single source of truth in the

structured state, and when one module changes something, others are designed to become aware. A good

example is NPC affinity: after each interaction, Module 04 not only updates the NPC’s affinity value in the

state manager’s record, but also creates a Relationship memory thread via the learning engine to log that

change

10

11

. This means the NPC’s changed attitude isn’t just stored in isolation – it propagates into the

memory system (for narrative recall) and can trigger in-story events (crossing a trust threshold triggers an

NPC behavior change)

12

. We see a detailed example where an affinity increase crosses from “Friendly” to

“Trusted”, causing a special dialogue and unlocking a new plot thread, and recording that event in memory

12

. Another cross-module binding is how  player feedback  is handled: when the player gives feedback

about the storytelling (e.g. “tone too serious”), the Learning engine creates a high-heat  PLAYER_FEEDBACK

memory   thread,   and   then   the   Cognitive   Engine   automatically   checks   for   such   threads   before   every

response to adjust the narrative style immediately

13

14

. This showcases how a change in one component

(memory) is picked up by another (intent processing) to keep behavior consistent with player expectations.

Similarly,  Narrative   Calibration  adjustments   (Module   13)   update   the   character’s   narrative   profile
(structured   per   narrative_profile_schema.json )   and  “cascade   to   modules”  like   Session   Zero,   NPC

dialogue, and Combat to apply the new tone or pacing system-wide

15

. All these mechanisms indicate the

system carefully avoids siloed state: if a value changes or a decision is made in one place, it’s reflected

everywhere   relevant   (state   JSON,   memory   threads,   and   often   acknowledged   in   narrative).   The   use   of

schemas   and   memory   threads   as   common   interfaces   means   components   remain   in   sync.   I   did   not

encounter any obvious mismatches between instructions and schema fields – on the contrary, fields like HP,

XP,   affinity,   etc.   are   consistently   handled   through   their   schema   definitions,   and   instructions   explicitly

mention using the schema (or the schema-derived state) when updating or querying data. This binding of

instructions to schemas ensures the  LLM “game master” always has the data it expects  and prevents,

say, an instruction from assuming a field that wasn’t saved. In short, the instruction modules correctly map

to their data schemas (no obvious field mismatches) and use them to uphold state consistency across the

board. When something in the game world changes – an NPC’s relationship, a character’s stat, or a narrative

tone   setting   –   that   update   is   propagated   through   the   structured   state   and   memory   so   that   all   other

modules operate on the new truth

10

12

. This design greatly reduces the chance of inconsistency (e.g.

forgetting   to   update   one   place)   and   keeps   the   whole   system  internally   coherent  as   the   adventure

progresses.

Library and Content Interlinking

AIDM   v2   includes   extensive  library   files  (narrative   profiles,   genre   tropes,   power   systems,   mechanics

references)   which   are   integrated   in   a   dynamic,   on-demand   fashion.   The  PROFILE_INDEX.md  and

GENRE_TROPES_INDEX.md  act as master indexes for these libraries and are pre-loaded early (Tier 1) to

allow quick lookup without dumping all content at once

16

. This means the system initially knows  which

profiles or trope collections exist and can present choices, but the heavy text of specific profiles/tropes is

only loaded if needed, preserving token budget. The integration is done with clear hooks: for example,

during  Session Zero  and Narrative Calibration, the system uses the profile index to locate and retrieve

specific narrative profile files. Module 13’s procedure explicitly states: if a player requests a certain anime’s

storytelling   style,  “Open   PROFILE_INDEX.md,   find   the   profile   ID,   then   load   that   narrative_profile   file”,   finally

applying its values to the active narrative profile state

17

. This shows a direct and correct use of the index

as a navigation tool to dynamically pull in content libraries. The genre tropes index is used similarly when

the player chooses a genre or blend – the system will reference the index to identify relevant trope libraries
(e.g.  isekai_tropes.md ,  shonen_tropes.md ) and load a handful of them that match the campaign’s

genre mix. Because the indexes were optimized and contain summary info (e.g. listing available profiles/

2

tropes, maybe with brief descriptions), the AIDM can query them to decide which detailed files to fetch,

rather than hard-coding library loads. This lazy-loading architecture is explicitly part of the design

18

, and

ensures that combining content (like multiple genre files) is done  programmatically via the index files,

not by manually stuffing everything up front.

The   content   files   themselves   are   structured   consistently   to   allow  interchangeability   and   merging.   All

Narrative Profile  files follow a common schema/format – essentially an “anime narrative DNA” with the

same set of ten scale ratings and trope toggles for each anime. For instance, the Steins;Gate profile file lists

scales like Introspection vs Action = 8/10 (with rationale), Comedy vs Drama = 6/10, … up through Hopeful vs

Cynical

19

20

,

  and   also   details   key   tropes   on/off   (e.g.

 “inner_monologue_heavy”:

  true,

“tragic_backstory_reveals”:   true,   etc.).   Another   profile   (say   Naruto   or   Attack   on   Titan)   will   have   the   same

headings   and   structure   –   just   different   values   and   descriptions.   This   consistency   is   enforced   by   the

narrative_profile_schema.json, which defines those fields (10 numeric scales, ~15 trope booleans, plus

tonal descriptors) as required

21

22

. Because each profile adheres to this format, the system can swap

profiles in and out or even blend them (by averaging scales or combining tropes) without confusion. The

Genre Trope library files are likewise structured methodically: each genre file (isekai, shonen, seinen, etc.)
contains categorized trope lists, archetypes, and typical story arc breakdowns in a predictable layout. For
example,  isekai_tropes.md  starts with sub-genre tables (Reincarnation, Summoning, VRMMO, etc.) and

then sections like “Common Tropes” (Cheat Skills, Guild Systems, Harem, etc.), “Story Arcs (Arc 1: Arrival, Arc

2: Growth, …)”

23

24

, and so on. Other genre files (shonen, slice_of_life, etc.) use the same pattern of

presenting tropes and narrative structure. This uniformity means the Narrative Systems or Session Zero

modules can treat trope libraries generically – e.g. it knows each has sections it can draw from to flavor the

campaign, and merging tropes from multiple genres is just a matter of including elements from each file. In

practice, the system can handle two or more genre blends by loading multiple trope files and letting the

LLM reconcile them. There is explicit support for multi-genre campaigns: Session Zero asks the player’s

desired genre mix, and Module 13 (Narrative Calibration) or Module 06 will automatically include key trope

libraries   for   both   chosen   genres

25

.   If,   say,   a   campaign   is  “shonen   isekai”,   AIDM   will   use   both

shonen_tropes  and  isekai_tropes  libraries   in   concert.   The   libraries   themselves   are   written   to   be

complementary;   for   example,   one   might   cover   isekai-specific   mechanics   like  “Guild   rank   systems”

26

while the other adds shonen staples like “tournament arcs” – these aren’t inherently contradictory and can

coexist in the world. The system relies on the Game Master (LLM) to merge them logically, and given the

structured detail, it has the information to do so. Notably, the Power System libraries and stat frameworks

are designed for mix-and-match as well. AIDM provides separate files for common anime power paradigms

(mana   magic,   ki/chi,   psychic   powers,   etc.),   and   if   a   world   needs   to   accommodate   multiple,   it   can   load

several. The Anime Integration module is tasked with “Power System Harmonization” whenever multiple

anime sources (and thus potentially multiple power systems or mechanics) are in play

27

. This means it will

take elements from each relevant power-system library and create a unified ruleset so that, for instance,

chakra from Naruto, Quirks from My Hero Academia, and an RPG leveling system from Solo Leveling can all

function together without one invalidating the other. Indeed, one of the internal acceptance tests has AIDM

combine three disparate power systems and explicitly checks for “no contradictions or conflicts in mechanics”

as   a   success   criterion

28

.   The   system   passes   this   by   explaining   a   coherent   merged   framework   (e.g.

everyone has a Quirk gene,  and  chakra that can be trained, and the “System” quantifies both via levels) –

demonstrating that the content libraries can be blended and applied together smoothly. Crucially, because

AIDM uses  shared base mechanics  (HP/MP/SP, unified skill taxonomy, etc.) as a foundation, even wildly

different anime powers get mapped onto a common structure. For example, Solo Leveling’s RPG stats and

Naruto’s chakra both can translate into the character’s stat block (with chakra mapped to MP, etc.), avoiding

data loss. In summary, the libraries are well-indexed and systematically structured, enabling the DM to

3

dynamically load only the needed pieces and combine them. Interlinking is robust: the Profile and Trope

indexes provide the hooks to pull in specific content on demand, and each content file follows a template

that makes it interoperable with others. The result is that AIDM can support multi-genre or multi-anime

campaigns (even more than two at once) by assembling the relevant profile and trope data and then using

its harmonization logic to resolve any differences. I did not find evidence of unresolved contradictions in

how  the  system  merges  content;  in  fact  the  design  shows  careful  thought  in  how  different  systems  or

tropes might “cascade or merge” (for instance, a multi-anime world will generate a combined world state

and power rules, rather than ignoring one source)

27

. This modular library approach both prevents data

overload (unused lore stays unloaded) and provides flexibility to extend or blend content without rewriting

core logic.

External Integration (Web & Tools)

Anime Integration (Module 07) is designed to seamlessly bring outside knowledge (actual anime canon)

into the AIDM system while avoiding hallucinations or conflicts. It uses a strict  web research protocol

whenever   the   player   references   an   anime   or   requests   a   canon   element.   In   effect,   the   AIDM   treats   the

internet  (or  provided  databases)  as  an  extension  of  its  memory,  but  only  after  explicit  verification.  The

moment an anime reference is detected (even during Session Zero), AIDM halts any creative generation and

triggers Phase 0 “Media Reference Detection”, which leads into a research routine

29

. The module first

does a self-assessment of familiarity and if it’s anything less than fully expert, it will perform a live search.

The   system’s   policies   make   this   non-negotiable:  if   familiarity   is   L0–L2   (unknown   to   moderately   known),

“research is MANDATORY and BLOCKING”

30

. This means AIDM will not proceed with story content until it has

gathered information from external sources. It explicitly  forbids  shortcuts like relying on training data or

“making up” details – any attempt to do so is treated as a failure of protocol (the instructions even list

phrases like “did not need live search” as auto-fail triggers)

31

. Instead, AIDM must use the LLM’s browsing

capability to query reliable sources (the guidance suggests VS Battles Wiki for power scaling, fan wikis for

lore,   MyAnimeList   for   synopses,   etc.)   and   compile   the   findings.   The   integration   module   essentially

sandboxes   this   process   by   separating   it   into   distinct   steps:   research   ->   present   findings   ->   get   player

confirmation -> only then integrate. For example, if the player asks for Naruto’s chakra system in the game,

AIDM will say (paraphrasing): “I’m familiar with Naruto’s basics but will verify specifics,” then perform a search,

then output a structured summary like “Anime: Naruto – Chakra is spiritual/physical energy, used via hand

signs, five nature types, etc.” plus source citations, and finally ask “Does this match your understanding?”

32

33

.   Only   after   the   player   confirms   will   those   details   be   considered   “locked   in”   to   the   world.   This

verification   loop

34

  ensures   that   any   external   data   brought   in   is   checked   by   the   user,   dramatically

reducing hallucination risk. If the player says the info is wrong or wants changes, AIDM will correct it before

proceeding. This mechanism means calls to fetch external data are effectively sandboxed – the game won’t

run off unvetted info; it pauses for confirmation. If an anime reference is so obscure that no reliable info is

available,   or   the   model   lacks   browsing   in   that   environment,   AIDM   is   instructed   to  decline   or   defer

integration  rather   than   invent   facts.   The   module   lists   criteria   for   when   it   must   politely   refuse   (e.g.

“Familiarity   Level   0   and   no   way   to   verify   =   decline”),   and   provides   the   player   alternative   options:   use   an

inspired-but-original system, allow AIDM time to research later, or choose a different known reference

35

36

. An example given is a player asking for Hunter x Hunter’s Nen system exactly – if AIDM only vaguely

knows it, it will respond that it can’t implement Nen in full detail without research, then offer either a Nen-

inspired  custom system or to go do research if possible

36

. This shows a graceful fallback: rather than

hallucinate Nen mechanics, the AI is upfront and seeks guidance or a workaround. All of this indicates the

system   is  highly   cautious   and   structured   about   external   integration.   It   uses   the   LLM’s   web   search

feature as a tool to pull factual data and even has a notion of “research tokens” – e.g., it specifically mentions

4

pulling power scaling info (like VS Battles tiers) to keep power levels consistent

33

. The Anime Integration

process also integrates the fetched data in a controlled way: after research, it extracts the needed pieces

into the appropriate schemas. The instructions say to take  power system details  from research and map
them   into   the   power_system_schema.json ,   world   elements   into   the   anime_world_schema.json ,

and narrative style cues into a narrative profile (schema)

9

. This means external content isn’t just dumped

into prose; it’s converted into the same structured format the system uses for any internally-defined world.

By   sandboxing   external   info   into   schema   fields   and   requiring   player   approval,   AIDM   avoids   both

hallucination  and  inconsistency  –  the  imported  anime  elements  become  just  another  part  of  the  game

state, subject to the same rules and validations as everything else.

In   terms   of   integration   with  other   AIs,   agents,   or   tools,   AIDM   is   largely   self-contained   in   an   LLM

conversation but is built to be portable and extensible. The entire system is implemented as Markdown

instructions and JSON, so it can run on any sufficiently capable LLM – the user is even instructed that they

can upload the files to ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc., and it should work the same

37

. There’s no hard

dependency on a particular platform or API; this model-agnostic design is a form of compatibility. Moreover,

AIDM can interface with external tools in a limited way if the environment allows. For example, if the LLM
platform   supports   code   execution,   AIDM   provides   a   state_validator.py   script   that   can   be   run   to

double-check game state integrity

38

. This isn’t a core part of the LLM instructions (since not all models can

execute   code),   but   it’s   an   optional   integration   point   for   more   advanced   deployments.   Similarly,   the

architecture   notes   optional   multi-modal   enhancements   (like   image   generation   for   scenes)

38

  which

suggests AIDM could integrate with image-generating agents if available. These are forward-looking, but

the key takeaway is AIDM doesn’t do anything to preclude working alongside other AI services – it simply

doesn’t require them by default. The  session export/import  mechanism also underscores cross-system

interoperability.   When   you   export   a   game   (via   a   meta-command),   AIDM   produces   a   structured   JSON
(conforming   to   session_export_schema.json )   containing   the   entire   game   state:   character   stats,

inventory, world info, NPCs, memory threads, etc. This format is meant to be saved and later imported in a

new session, even potentially on a different model or tool. The State Manager (Module 03) can parse that

JSON back in to reconstruct everything exactly as it was

39

. This means you could, for example, export your

session from ChatGPT and then paste the JSON into a Claude session loaded with AIDM, and the game

would resume with the same state. The JSON is self-contained and human-readable, so it’s also possible for

external tools or scripts to modify or generate (though doing so outside the AIDM’s logic could be risky

without following schema). Still, the fact that game state is in a standard JSON format means it’s not locked

into one AI’s memory – it’s a transferable save file like in a regular video game. This opens the door for

collaborative or augmented scenarios (e.g. two players sharing a state file between their own AI instances,

or a separate program generating procedural content into the JSON which AIDM then reads). The  export

format works cleanly across sessions and presumably across compatible systems  – it’s deliberately

designed for copy-paste portability

40

39

.

In summary, AIDM’s external integration approach is very robust against hallucination (enforcing real-time

research and user verification for any external info) and is implemented in a sandboxed way that funnels

new data into structured state. The system expects a modern LLM with web access to fully enable this

feature (web search is listed as a required capability)

41

. If that capability is missing, AIDM won’t break – it

will either ask the player for information or limit itself to general knowledge with warnings, as per its rules.

For other integrations, AIDM is highly portable and can leverage external tools where available but doesn’t

rely on them. The careful design around exporting state and avoiding model-specific hacks indicates a good

degree of interoperability with other AI sessions and tools.

5

Failure Tolerance and Module Isolation

The AIDM system includes explicit measures for  graceful failure handling  and isolating faults, so that a

problem   in   one   module   doesn’t   crash   the   entire   game.   During   initialization,   a  System   Health   Check
classifies modules into tiers: Critical Systems (the Cognitive engine, Learning/memory, and State Manager)

must be operational or the game cannot proceed, whereas other systems like NPC Intelligence, Narrative,

Combat are “Important” but not absolutely vital, and some (Session Zero, Anime Integration, Progression)

are deemed optional after startup

42

. If a non-critical module is unavailable or fails to load, AIDM will not

halt; it switches to a  degraded mode  where that module’s functionality is turned off, and it informs the

player of the limitation

43

. For example, if the Combat module (08) were to fail or wasn’t loaded (perhaps

due   to   token   limits),   the   system   would   continue   the   story   without   detailed   combat   resolution   –   likely

narrating outcomes more generally – and explicitly note that the combat subsystem is offline. We see this

philosophy   in   the   Error   Recovery   and   Core   instructions:  “Tier   2   failure   →   Degraded   mode   (‘[system]
. The  Error Recovery  Module 10 is always loaded as a safety net and is invoked whenever
OFFLINE’)”

44

inconsistencies or errors are detected in output. It acts as a form of runtime “circuit breaker.” For instance, if

an update to HP or inventory doesn’t match the schema or if narrative output seems to contradict the

tracked state, Error Recovery procedures kick in to address it before things derail. The core instructions say:

“On   errors:   Pause   →   load   10_error_recovery.md   →   explain   issue   →   propose   solutions   →   get   approval   →

document fix → resume. Never hide errors.”
the AI will stop and acknowledge something went wrong, rather than pushing forward with corrupted state.

. This ensures the session doesn’t silently spiral out of control;

45

In practice, this might look like the AI saying “ERROR: HP went negative, that shouldn’t happen. Let’s

correct this.” and offering the player options to resolve the mistake (rewind, adjust the value, etc.). This
transparent handling prevents minor failures in one part from propagating – the error is isolated, corrected

or mitigated, and then play continues.

The   AIDM   instructions   also   outline   specific  fallback   modes  for   various   failure   scenarios.   If   a   required

instruction file is missing or couldn’t be loaded, the AI is told to acknowledge its absence and attempt to

continue with general knowledge, while warning the player that its capabilities are limited until that file is

provided

46

. For example, if somehow the NPC module wasn’t available, AIDM would say NPC behaviors

will be simpler or not tracked, and advise uploading the module when possible – but it would still carry on

with the rest of its functionality rather than quitting. If a JSON schema file is missing, the guidance is to use

a simplified data structure (even plain text notes) to track that information and caution the player that

exports or validations might be incomplete

47

. This means the system can operate in a reduced form even

if it doesn’t have a formal schema – albeit with less rigor – prioritizing continuity of play. A particularly

critical scenario is memory failure: if for some reason the memory threads were lost or the context window

caused earlier info to drop, AIDM will engage Error Recovery to  reconstruct state from the player. It

would ask the player to confirm important details that it can’t recall, rebuild the memory threads or state as

needed, and mark that this reconstruction happened

48

. This again shows a fail-safe: even if the LLM’s own

context limitations cause forgetting, the system has a plan to recover rather than blindly continue with

missing context.

For external failures like web search being unavailable or yielding no results, as discussed above, AIDM will

not hallucinate; it will either ask the user for guidance or offer to proceed with a non-canon approach. In

essence, the system degrades gracefully by design: lacking external data, it can fall back to improvisation

with the player’s consent  (e.g.  “I can’t verify that anime, shall we make something up inspired by it?”), which

prevents unwarranted errors. An example from the Anime Integration module was the Nen scenario: the AI

admitted it didn’t know enough and offered alternative paths rather than forging ahead incorrectly

36

. This

6

kind of player-involved fallback keeps the story on track even when ideal data isn’t accessible, and it isolates

the “failure” (in this case, inability to retrieve info) to that aspect without breaking the overall narrative flow.

The system also provides recovery options for  invalid or corrupt data inputs. When importing a saved

session, the State Manager performs validations (even checksum verification) to ensure the JSON is intact. If

the import is found to be corrupted or inconsistent, AIDM doesn’t just crash or blindly use it – it presents

the player with options: try to load anyway (with potential errors), load a backup if one was kept, or start a

new game if it’s irreparable

49

. For example,  “Corrupted save detected – would you like to attempt recovery,

use a backup, or begin a new session?” This kind of prompt again fences off the issue and lets the user decide

how to proceed, rather than leaving the game in an undefined state. Even in mid-game, if some data goes

out of bounds (say an NPC’s affinity goes above 100 due to a bug), the Error Recovery would likely catch it

and either auto-correct or ask the player to pick the right value, then continue.

Finally, the core System Initialization (Module 00) itself is built to validate everything at start and only go

forward if the foundation is solid. It checks that all required schemas are present and properly formatted

before allowing play

50

. If any are missing, it will halt with an error message (since schemas are critical)

rather   than   let   the   game   start   in   a   broken   state

51

.   This   prevents   fragile   sessions   from   ever   starting

unknowingly. It also runs a health check after loading modules: if a critical module failed to load or initialize,

it will stop with an error (“SYSTEM CANNOT START – CRITICAL FAILURE”)

42

. If a less critical one failed, it will

warn and run in degraded mode as noted. So the system won’t enter gameplay with a half-functional core;

it either fixes the issue (by prompting uploads, etc.) or clearly communicates the limitation.

Overall, AIDM demonstrates strong fault tolerance. Each module is as isolated as it can be in a monolithic

LLM context – they share state but have independent logic, so a flaw in, say, the combat logic won’t affect

memory storage or narrative generation except that combat features are absent. Cross-cutting checks (like

Error Recovery’s consistency scans) ensure one module’s mistakes are caught and not allowed to confuse

others. Importantly, the AI is instructed to be transparent about any degradation: it explicitly tells the player

when something has gone wrong or a subsystem is offline, rather than silently misbehaving. This design

choice   maintains   trust   and   allows   the   player   to   adapt   (perhaps   avoiding   actions   related   to   the   failed

module, or helping provide missing info). From an audit perspective, the  degree of resilience is high:

multiple safeguards (schema validation, health checks, error recovery prompts) guard against system-wide

failure. One area that requires ongoing diligence is ensuring these safeguards cover all edge cases – e.g.,

the Cognitive Engine correctly classifying an odd player input so that it doesn’t bypass the needed module

(if it misroutes an input, the appropriate instructions might not execute). But given the structure, even if

something odd happens, the Error Recovery or Player Agency module (which monitors rule violations like

the Sacred Rule) would likely intervene. The AIDM v2 architecture has clearly been built with the assumption

that things will go wrong at times (because of the open-ended nature of AI storytelling), and it provides a

framework to contain and resolve those issues rather than letting the whole experience collapse. Improving

further might involve even more automated self-healing (for instance, if a module file is missing, perhaps

offering to load an older version or stub), but as it stands, the system is already robust in preventing “single

point” failures. Each module failing results in a controlled reduction in functionality, not a cascade. This

modular isolation, combined with explicit fallback behaviors and player-in-the-loop recovery, means AIDM

can continue operating under suboptimal conditions with grace and transparency
