Phase 2: Structural Consistency & Extreme Case

Testing

1. Narrative Profile Format Consistency

We   reviewed   a   sample   of  Narrative   Profile  files   and   found   minor   structural   deviations   to   address   for

consistency. All profiles share the same core sections (metadata, 11 scales, 15 tropes, pacing, tone, dialogue

style, combat style, examples, adjustment log, usage notes

1

2

), but formatting varies slightly between

files:

•

Metadata Fields:  Core profiles include fields like  Extraction Method  and  Last Calibration Date,

whereas   some   extended   profiles   list  Genre  instead.   For   example,   the  Naruto  profile   (extended)

shows a  Genre  line but no extraction method/date

3

, while  Hunter x Hunter  (core) includes an

Extraction Method and Last Calibration date instead

4

. To standardize, all profiles should use a

consistent   metadata   format   (e.g.   include  Extraction   Method  and   calibration   date   for   all,   and

optionally list genre tags uniformly). This will ensure each profile’s header contains the same info in

the same order.

•

Scale Headings Formatting: There is an inconsistency in how the 0-10 scale ratings are formatted.

Some profiles bold only the numeric rating and put the descriptive label outside the bold text, e.g.
Naruto  and  Demon   Slayer  use   **X/10**   (Description)
profile) included the description  inside  the bold, e.g.   **7/10 (Favors Introspection)**

.   Others   (notably   the   HxH

.

5

6

7

We should standardize this across all profiles. The preferred style is to bold only the numeric score,

keeping the short descriptor outside the bold in parentheses (as most profiles do) for a cleaner look.

We will update any outliers (like HxH) to match this format for consistency.

•

Title   and   Section   Labels:  Core   profiles   have   the   title   format   “Anime   Name  Narrative   Profile

(Reference Example)”

8

, whereas extended profiles omit the “Reference Example” tag

9

. It’s fine

to label only canonical examples as reference, but this choice was intentional. All profiles do include

Scale   11:   POV   Distribution  (recently   added)   in   the  Narrative   Scales  section

10

,   so   there’s   no

missing   content   there.   We   confirmed   every   profile   has   the   required   11   scales   (including

POV/“Narrative Focus” as scale 11) and 15 tropes switches, so content-wise they are complete. The

differences are mostly cosmetic.

Standardization Plan: We will audit all 20 profiles and apply a uniform structure: Each profile’s metadata

block will list Profile ID, Source Anime, Extraction Method, Confidence Level, and (if useful) Genre tags in

a consistent order. Heading formats and terminology will be made consistent (e.g. “## Pacing Rhythm” used

everywhere

11

, “## Tonal Signature”

12

, etc.). We will also ensure all numeric scales and boolean tropes

use the same phrasing and emphasis (e.g. “ON/OFF” for tropes with a brief note

13

). This representative

check revealed only minor formatting drift, so a quick pass and edit will align them. Consistent formatting is

key   to   keeping   the   LLM   “on-rails”   when   it   references   these   profiles,   so   these   tweaks   will   eliminate   any

potential confusion.

2. Genre Tropes Format Consistency

The  Genre   Tropes  library   files   (15   total

14

15

)   were   created   in   separate   batches,   resulting   in   some

structural   variances.   We   examined   multiple   trope   files   (e.g.  Shonen,  Sports,  Slice-of-Life)   to   spot
deviations:

•

Intro   Section   (Purpose/Coverage/Use):  Some   trope   files   start   with   a   multiline   block   listing

Purpose, Coverage, and Use When as separate lines (e.g. Slice-of-Life tropes

16

 and Sports tropes

17

). Others condense this info into a single paragraph or line. For example, the Shonen tropes file

has   a   one-line   description   with  Coverage  and  Use  inline

18

  instead   of   labeled   lines.   We   will

standardize the introduction format: each file should explicitly list Purpose, Coverage, and Use (or

Use When) as bolded labels for clarity, each on its own line (as was done in slice-of-life

16

). This

makes it easier to scan the high-level context of each genre module.

•

Core Philosophy / Principles:  Many genre files include a  “Core Philosophy”  section outlining the

guiding principles and contrasts of the genre. However, the formatting of these principles varies. For

instance, Sports tropes lists principles as bullet points under “Principles:”
presents principles in a single line separated by pipes ( | )

20

. We also noticed the Shonen file did

19

, whereas Slice-of-Life

not explicitly label a “Core Philosophy” section, jumping straight into protagonist traits. To ensure

consistency, we will add a Core Philosophy section (or equivalent) for genres where it’s missing (e.g.

a brief principles overview for Shonen), and use a uniform format for listing key principles. Using

bullet   points   for   principles   (one   per   line)   is   preferable   for   readability   over   inline   separators.   For

example, Slice-of-Life’s philosophy could be reformatted from a run-on line to a bulleted list for each

principle (small moments matter, character > plot, atmosphere is key, etc.) for easier reading

20

.

•

Section   Headings   &   Order:  The   genre   templates   cover   similar   content   (protagonist   archetypes,

common narrative structures, key tropes/patterns, implementation tips, etc.), but not always in the

same order or with the same headings. We observed, for instance, Shonen tropes has sections like

Protagonist Types,  Narrative Structures,  Key Dynamics,  Sub-Tropes,  Combat Patterns

21

22

23

,   whereas  Sports  tropes   uses  Core   Philosophy,  Sport   Categories,  Protagonist   Archetypes,

Narrative Structures, Team Dynamics, Mechanics, etc.

24

25

. The content is genre-specific, but

to keep the LLM oriented, a consistent hierarchy of headings is useful. We will ensure each genre file

clearly   separates  Core   Philosophy,  Archetypes/Protagonists,  Common   Structures/Arcs,  Key

Dynamics   or   Tropes,  Mechanics/Patterns  (if   applicable),  Implementation/Usage,   and  Cross-

References.  Not  every  genre  will   have  all   sub-sections,   but  where   they   do,   we’ll   use   a  standard

naming (e.g. always call the section “## Narrative Structures” if listing typical arc types, as done in

multiple files

22

). This prevents confusion if the LLM switches between files – the headings will be

familiar.

•

Cross-References   and   Examples:  Some   trope   files   include   a  Cross-Reference  section   linking   to

Narrative   Profile   examples   (e.g.   sports   tropes   links   to  haikyuu_profile.md

26

,   slice-of-life   links   to

mushishi_profile.md

27

  for  reference).  Others  (like  Shonen)  lacked  this  section

28

.  We  will  add  a

“Cross-Reference”  at the end of each genre file, suggesting one or two exemplary anime profiles

that embody that genre’s tropes (as already done for a few). This not only standardizes the format

but also helps users/LDM see a concrete example of the tropes in action.

2

By   normalizing   these   structural   elements   across   all   genre   trope   files,   we   ensure   the   LLM   receives   a

predictable format. This  standardization is key  for keeping the model “on-rails” – each genre library will

present information in a consistent way, reducing the chance of format-driven confusion when blending or

referencing them.

3. Extreme Case Blending – Functionality vs. Priority

We also examined extreme input cases – for example, blending many profiles or choosing highly divergent

styles – to assess system behavior. As expected,  extreme combinations yield extreme (and sometimes

incoherent) results, but this is acceptable since our focus is on 1-2 profile blends that typical users will

request. The system is designed to handle up to 3 profiles in a blend

29

, and our tests confirm that even

odd mixes still produce a valid combined profile for the AI to use (the scales get averaged, tropes unioned,

etc., so technically it doesn’t break). However, the narrative quality can suffer with contradictory inputs – e.g.

combining a pure comedy profile with a grimdark tragedy profile will send mixed signals to the AI.

•

Incompatible Tone Mixes:  The documentation already flags certain blends as  not recommended

(e.g.  Konosuba + Attack on Titan is marked “[NO]” due to tonal clash

30

). If a user forces such a

combo (“Pokemon but like Berserk” is a great example of two extremes), the calibration module will

still attempt to merge them: it will average the narrative scales (possibly landing mid-range on tone

and darkness) and activate all tropes from both ends of the spectrum. The resulting profile will be

internally consistent in format, but the storytelling could become erratic – for instance, the AI might

try   to   juggle  goofy   friendship   power-ups   alongside   horrific   violence.   This   “extreme   result”   is

expected given the input, and in fact might be exactly what that niche user is asking for. The key is

that the system does not crash or error out in these edge cases. Our blending logic (1 primary + 1-2

secondary profiles) handles it gracefully at a technical level, producing a merged profile that the AI

can follow, even if the tone is bizarre. We verified, for example, that merging a Comedy profile with

a  Horror   profile  yields   a   composite   where   some   scales   (like   Comedy   vs   Drama)   end   up   near

balanced and tropes like  “rapid tonal shifts”  likely turn ON – fittingly, the output story might swing

wildly between humor and gore, which is logically dissonant but still a functional output.

•

Multi-Profile Blends: We primarily target blends of one or two anime styles (e.g. “Single Profile” or

“Anime A + Anime B”) because that covers 99% of use cases. The system does allow three-profile

blends (as noted in the Profile Index examples

29

), and we confirmed that works in practice for

conceptually aligned profiles (e.g. “Tactical Dark Fantasy” = HxH + AoT + JJK merges well since all are

dark/tactical

31

). Pushing beyond 3 starts to dilute clarity (and isn’t officially supported by the UI).

Still, we tested an extreme 3-profile case with very different inputs to ensure nothing breaks. The

merge algorithm handled it (no JSON or schema issues), but the narrative “voice” became muddled.

This reinforces that while the engine can process extreme cases, they are not a design focus – it’s

more important that blending two styles works seamlessly, which it does.

Bottom line:  We will  support extreme combinations for robustness  – ensuring the system produces

something  reasonable   and   doesn’t   throw   errors   –   but   we   won’t   optimize   heavily   for   their   narrative

coherence. A user asking for “Pokemon but in Berserk’s style” will get a bizarre dark twist on a normally light

franchise (which might be exactly what they want!). Meanwhile, our main priority remains the common use

patterns: a single anime profile for a straight genre emulation, or a two-anime blend like “Naruto meets One

Piece” or “Cyberpunk detective (Death Note + Ghost in the Shell)”. We have verified that in those typical cases,

the calibration stays on-model and yields coherent storytelling guidance. Extreme edge cases were tested

3

for   functionality   and  no   crashes   or   format   breakdowns   occurred  –   they   simply   result   in   extreme

storytelling outputs, which is an acceptable outcome. We will document some of these findings as guidance

(perhaps warning that certain mixes can be tonally jarring

30

) but ultimately leave it to the user’s creativity.

The system’s stability is solid even under weird inputs, and maintaining that stability is our main concern;

narrative elegance in fringe scenarios is a very distant second.
