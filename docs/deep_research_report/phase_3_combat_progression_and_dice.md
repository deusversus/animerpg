Phase 3 Audit: Combat, Progression, and Dice

Systems (AIDM v2)

Combat System Tactical Depth

•

Action Economy & Turn Sequence:  The system uses a  turn-based, round structure  where each

character gets 1 Major action (attack/skill) and 1 Minor action (movement/item use) per turn,

plus reactions

1

. Initiative is rolled each round (DEX + 1d20) to determine turn order

1

. This

mirrors JRPG/TT RPG norms and provides a clear action economy for tactical planning.

•

Status Effects & Conditions:  A variety of  conditions  (stun, poison, bleed, paralysis, blind, prone,

buffs/debuffs, etc.) are supported with mechanical impacts

2

3

. The system uses contested rolls

to apply statuses (e.g. attacker’s roll vs target’s CON/WIS to resist)

2

. This adds tactical depth in

inflicting or mitigating states. Common buffs like  Haste  (extra action) and debuffs like  Slow  or  Burn

are   defined   with   numeric   effects

3

.   The   presence   of   these   conditions   shows   robust   tactical

granularity, though ensuring a comprehensive list (e.g. knockdown vs prone, stacking of effects) is

important.

•

Environmental Interaction & Destructibility: The combat engine accounts for terrain and cover

(e.g.   cover   grants   +2   or   +4   DEF,   full   cover   =   untargetable

4

)   and   even   allows  environmental

can   set   an
destruction
environmental_destruction   level (High/Moderate/Low) to reflect how much battles wreck the

 narrative   profile’s   combat   style

in   narration.

  The

surroundings

5

. For example, in a high-destruction anime profile, attacks might shatter walls and

crater the ground, whereas in a low-destruction setting the environment stays intact. The  Victory

narration   protocol  explicitly   calls   for   describing   environmental   changes   (scorch   marks,   cracked

floors, etc.) after a battle

6

, reinforcing that terrain impact is part of the storytelling. Overall, the

system   encourages   using   the   environment   (e.g.   high   ground   granting   Advantage

7

)   and

destructive scenery for tactical and dramatic effect. One gap is the lack of explicit mechanics for

interactive scenery  (e.g. using objects, collapsing structures) beyond narrative – adding a simple

framework for environment hazards or improvised actions (like knocking over pillars or using terrain

for cover beyond static bonuses) could enhance tactical play.

•

Boss Mechanics & Phases:  Boss fights are given special treatment. Bosses can have  multiple HP

bars   and   phase   triggers  (at   75%,   50%,   25%   HP)   that   alter   their   behavior   or   abilities

8

.   For

example, a boss might summon minions at 75% HP or transform at 50% HP

9

. They also feature

unique mechanics, like environmental hazards or special attacks, and narrative beats such as mid-

battle   dialogue

8

.   This   design   adds   depth   and  escalation  to   major   encounters.   The   module

ensures bosses feel epic – e.g. guaranteed loot drops and story significance are mentioned

8

. One

strength here is the integration of narrative pacing with mechanics (the boss might taunt or change

strategy in Phase 2, aligning with anime “power-up” tropes). A possible area to expand is defining

specific boss phase templates or resistances  (e.g. armor breaking in phase 2, enraged berserk

1

phase, etc.) to guide GMs. But overall, the presence of phase-based design indicates a well-thought-

out boss encounter system in line with JRPG/anime climactic fights.

•

Area-of-Effect   &   Positioning:  The   combat   rules   support  area-of-effect   (AOE)   attacks   and

positioning.   AOEs   require   each   target   to   make   a   saving   throw   vs   a   difficulty   (often   attacker’s

stat+DC); on success they take half damage

10

. For instance, a fireball might force multiple enemies

to roll DEX saves against INT+10, with successes taking ½ damage

10

. Positioning considerations

are   reflected   through  Advantage/Disadvantage  mechanics   for   flanking,   range,   or   cover   (e.g.

flanking  an  enemy  grants  Advantage  on  your  attack  roll,  being  prone  or  at  long  range  imposes

Disadvantage)

4

11

. The system doesn’t explicitly use a grid, but concepts like high ground (+1 to

hit) or melee disengagement provoking reactions

7

  suggest a spatial component.  Opportunity

attacks are included (leaving melee can trigger a free attack unless the character disengages or is

teleporting)

7

. This indicates the game accounts for relative positioning and movement tactics.

What could be added is a more detailed handling of  distance and zones  – currently movement is

just a “Minor” action without specified distance, so defining how far a character can move or when

multiple   combatants   can   be   targeted   would   add   clarity.   Still,   the   included   rules   for   AoE   and
Advantage make the system tactically rich in positioning.

•

Mass Combat & Tournaments: The system can handle groups of enemies by using group initiative

for mobs of the same type (e.g. all generic goblins act on one initiative)

10

, which helps simplify

large battles. Area attacks and multi-target damage are supported for mass combat scenarios (the

damage example shows multiple goblins each taking appropriate damage from one fireball)

12

13

.

However, there is no dedicated mass-combat ruleset for armies or units – battles are resolved at the

individual character scale, which could become cumbersome at very large scales. For  tournament

arcs, the framework relies on sequential duels or narrative framing rather than special mechanics.

The  narrative profiles and trope libraries  acknowledge tournament arcs as a genre convention

(e.g.   recommending  Hunter   x   Hunter  or  Naruto  profiles   for   a   tournament   scenario)

14

15

,   but

mechanically   a   tournament   is   just   a   series   of   standard   combats.   There   aren’t   explicit   rules   for

between-match recovery, bracket seeding, or special tournament conditions.  Recommendation:  If

frequent mass battles or tournaments are expected, consider adding an abstracted combat mode

(mass combat rules for resolving armies with fewer rolls, or a tournament management system to

handle   successive   fights   and   fatigue/injury   between   them).   As   it   stands,   the   system   supports

moderate group combats well but could extend to true large-scale war or structured tournament

play with additional rules.

Progression & Leveling Mechanics

•

Experience (XP) & Advancement Pacing:  The progression system defines clear  XP rewards for

various activities and a paced leveling curve. Combat XP is based on enemy level: each level has a

base XP value (e.g. an L4 enemy ~350 XP) adjusted by a difficulty modifier (e.g. fighting higher-level

enemies yields ×1.5 to ×2.0, trivial low-level enemies yield 0.1×)

16

. Bosses are worth triple XP for

their level

17

. In addition to combat,  non-combat awards are significant: quests grant XP based

on   difficulty   (minor   100   up   to   epic   2000)   with   quality   multipliers

16

,   and   roleplay,   exploration,

puzzles,   negotiation   can   grant   roughly   25–200   XP   each

18

.   There   are   even   XP   awards   for   story

milestones (first use of a skill, forming relationships, key story beats)

18

  – this encourages well-

rounded play, not just combat grinding. The  pacing  is designed such that early levels go fast and

higher levels slow down: recommended XP per 2-hour session is ~600–900 for a balanced session

2

(with 1–1.5k in a boss-heavy epic session)

19

. They estimate ~2–3 sessions per level at low levels, up

to 6–10 sessions per level at high levels

20

, aiming to avoid both stagnation and excessive power

creep. Overall this XP system is comprehensive and aligns with “every level tells a story” by rewarding

diverse gameplay. The difficulty scaling (akin to CR) helps maintain encounter balance by scaling XP

and implicitly guiding that e.g. 3+ levels above the party is “Deadly” (and yields 2× XP)

16

. One thing

to watch is that XP tables cap at L10 then use a linear formula, but the  power system libraries

define power tiers beyond L20

21

22

 – ensuring the XP progression continues smoothly into very

high   levels   (for   campaigns   simulating   long-running   shonen   series)   might   require   extension   or

milestone leveling after a point. But for most campaigns, the provided XP curve and pacing seem

well-tuned.

•

Level-Up   Rewards   &   Stat   Growth:  Leveling   up   yields   predictable,   incremental   growth   to   avoid

runaway scaling. XP thresholds rise per level (e.g. ~1000 for level 2, 2000 more for level 3, scaling up

to ~26k total for level 10, then ~Level×3000 thereafter)

23

. Each level grants +10 HP, +10 MP, +5 SP

(stamina)   automatically,   plus  +2   attribute   points   and   +1   skill   point  to   allocate

24

.   This   means

every level characters get a bit tougher and stronger, but the bounded per-level gains (+2 to stats)
keep the power curve moderate. There are milestone levels (5, 10, 15, 20) that give an extra bonus

(an additional skill point and unlocking a new “tier” of abilities or power)

25

  – this nicely mirrors

many   RPGs   where   certain   levels   are   big   power   spikes.   An   example   level-up   is   given   showing   a

character’s HP/MP increasing and the player distributing their new stat points and improving a skill

26

. The design ensures bounded accuracy and scaling: attributes have a soft cap of 20 (hard cap

25 with special means) and increasing an attribute past 18 costs extra points

27

. This cap means

even at high levels, stats won’t inflate infinitely – a design choice to maintain challenge by preventing

stats   from   going   godlike   beyond   the   content’s   scaling.   This   is   reinforced   by   “bounded”   hit   and

damage formulas (e.g. defense is 10 + stats + armor, so an enemy’s Defense doesn’t outgrow the d20

range dramatically). The stat cap and moderate per-level gains embody  bounded accuracy: even a

max-level  character  can  be  challenged  by  lower-level  threats  if  outnumbered  or  outmaneuvered,

since d20 rolls remain swingy. Overall, level rewards feel rewarding (consistent HP/MP increases and

customization   via   points)   without   breaking   the   game’s   math.   It’s   also   genre-flexible:   the  Stat

Frameworks library provides alternate stat scales (e.g. for more exponential shonen growth or story-

driven   stat   boosts)

28

,   which   suggests   the   system   designers   have   considered   power   creep   and

allowed optional rules for campaigns that intentionally want DBZ-level exponential power vs those

that want a steadier climb.

•

Skill Acquisition & Mastery:  Character abilities improve through a mix of  point-buy and usage-

based progression. Every level, the player gains 1 skill point to invest in raising a skill or learning a

new one (active progression)

29

. Separately, skills also  gain XP through use: each time a skill is

used in a meaningful way, it earns a small amount of skill-specific XP (more if used in a challenging

situation)

29

.   When   a   skill’s   XP   reaches   a   threshold,   the   skill’s   rank   increases   (independent   of

character level) – representing training by doing. For example, a Stealth skill at L2 might need 400 SP

XP to reach L3, gaining ~+30 XP each time it’s used in a challenging stealth scenario

30

. This dual

system (spending points vs natural use) is reminiscent of systems like Elder Scrolls or some JRPGs,

and it rewards players for  actually employing their abilities  instead of only waiting for level-ups.

Each skill level can unlock mastery bonuses at certain breakpoints – e.g. Life Transfer spell might

become more efficient at rank 3, gain new properties at rank 5, etc., up to an “Ultimate” effect at

rank 10

30

. The example given shows Life Transfer healing becomes more effective and gains range

as it levels, and ultimately grants a resurrection ability at highest rank

30

. This is excellent for genre

3

fidelity   (characters   hone   signature   moves   over   time,   potentially   unveiling   new   “forms”   or

techniques). The system thus supports both breadth (learn new skills with skill points) and depth

(master   favorite   skills   by   practice).   It’s   a   robust   approach;   however,   tracking   use-based   XP   could

become a bookkeeping burden. The AIDM as a GM would presumably automate this (“skill usage

memory threads” via the Learning Engine). It will be important that the  LLM tracks skill XP fairly

and transparently, much like it does combat rolls. One potential addition could be training rules:

currently skills grow by combat/use or level-up allocation, but an out-of-combat training montage

could be another avenue (perhaps grant a chunk of skill XP or a free skill point after significant

downtime or narrative training, as suggested by some narrative profiles). This would reflect anime

training arcs where characters improve outside of battle.

•

Encounter Balance & Bounded Accuracy:  The system provides guidelines to balance encounters

via   both   the   XP   modifier   (for   difficulty)   and   a   quick   reference   table   for   encounter   difficulty.   For

instance, an “Easy” encounter is ~1 enemy per PC of equal level, “Medium” might be 1.5× enemies

or +2 levels higher, up to “Deadly” at ~3+ enemies per PC or +6 levels higher

31

. These guidelines

31

  help  GMs  design  fights  that  match  the   party’s  power.   Combined  with   the   XP  scaling  (which
rewards higher difficulty more), the intention is clear: challenge should scale with the party, and

trivial   fights   fade   out   (since   XP   for   “3   levels   below”   is   only   10%).   The  bounded   stat   growth

mentioned earlier (soft cap ~20) ensures that  attack bonuses and defenses remain in a range

where the d20 roll matters; a +5 vs +15 attack gap is significant but not insurmountable with a

1d20 swing. This prevents high-level characters from being untouchable by anything lower, staying

true to many anime where even top fighters can be surprised or hurt by weaker foes under the right

conditions. The system also has an  injury/knockdown check  after fights

32

  (implying characters

might suffer lasting effects when dropping to 0 HP, though the exact mechanics aren’t detailed),

which could factor into encounter balance by making defeat more costly than just a quick revive.

Recommendation: It might be useful to formalize a Challenge Rating (CR) or encounter budgeting

tool for GMs (e.g. sum of enemy levels vs party levels) beyond the quick heuristics, but the provided

difficulty   and   XP   tables   serve   the   purpose   well.   So   far,   bounded   accuracy   plus   these   guidelines

indicate  the  game  is  designed  to  avoid  the  “rocket  tag”  problem  –  a  positive  sign  for  long-term

balance.

•

Build Diversity & Multiclassing: The progression design supports a wide variety of character builds.

The use of attribute points and skill points every level means players can customize stat spreads

(e.g. a STR/CON “tank” vs a DEX/WIS rogue or a CHA-focused face)

33

. The documents explicitly

mention example builds like Combat Healer, Glass Cannon Mage, Tank, Rogue, etc., showing the

system expects players to specialize or hybridize as they wish

33

. To further this, at  Level 10 the

system allows multiclassing: the character can take on a secondary class which starts at Level 1

and then progresses in parallel

34

. The example given is a Level 10 healer adding “Paladin L1” as a

secondary, immediately gaining some Paladin skills and even hybrid abilities (like a healing strike

that combines offense and healing)

34

. This is a great nod to anime protagonists who often gain

new powers or disciplines mid-story (e.g. a swordsman learning magic later, etc.). Multiclassing is

restricted until level 10, which ensures early game characters establish a primary identity before

branching  out  –  a  sensible  balance.  The  stat/skill  system  is  flexible  enough  that  even  without

formal   class   changes,   a   player   could   create   a   “hybrid”   by   distributing   points   broadly   (the   build

examples mention a hybrid build)

33

. Also, because the power system libraries (Mana, Ki, etc.) are

modular, a character could theoretically access multiple energy systems if the narrative allows (the

integration notes say hybrids like a spellblade (Mana+Ki) are possible with GM approval)

35

36

. All

4

of this supports build diversity. We should ensure the AIDM logic respects these combinations – e.g.

when  a  multiclass  happens,  the  GM  should  introduce  the  new  class’s  skill  tree,  etc.  One  area  to

possibly enhance is prestige or advanced classes: the system stops at dual-class, but anime often

feature evolving archetypes (a character might start as “martial artist” and become “Super Saiyan”

which   is   like   an   advanced   class).   This   could   be   handled   narratively   or   via   the   power-system   tier

unlocks, so it’s not a glaring omission, just a potential extension (perhaps an “advanced specialization”

at   high   level   that   grants   unique   trait   beyond   normal   leveling).   As   it   stands,   the   framework

encourages diverse character growth, avoiding a one-size-fits-all progression.

•

Integration with Power Systems & Loot: The progression mechanics tie in with the power system

libraries  to ensure genre-specific growth. Each power system file defines a  “Power Budget” per

level   range  (e.g.   Ki   users   from   Lv11-15   unlock   transformations   like   Super   Saiyan,   Soul   users   at

Lv16-20 achieve “True Bankai” levels, etc.)

37

22

. This means the generic leveling system (+stats,

+skills)   is   augmented   by   power-specific   milestones.   For   example,   a   sorcerer   following   the   Mana

system will, by mid-levels, accumulate enough MP and spells to perform Tier 3 magic (battlefield-

altering spells)
advanced techniques

38

39

, whereas a Ki user by those levels gains things like transformation forms or
. Because these are documented, the AIDM can narratively foreshadow and

40

deliver these power-ups at the appropriate levels.  Loot and gear  are mentioned in passing (post-

combat   loot   drops,   the   Stat   library   noting   gear   can   affect   stats,   etc.),   but   there   isn’t   an   explicit

economy or itemization system described in these core files. We know armor types affect Defense

and   Damage   Reduction

41

,   and   weapons   have   damage   dice   (e.g.   longsword   1d8)

42

,   so   gear

matters in mechanics. However, how players acquire better gear (shops, crafting, random drops?) is

not detailed – likely left to narrative. The Genre/Isekai variations mention a Luck stat for loot and a

Fame stat influencing prices

43

, implying that a money/merchant system is expected, but it’s not

fleshed out here.  Recommendation:  To strengthen progression, a more concrete  loot/economy

system could be integrated: e.g. treasure tables or gold rewards tied to quests, and guidelines for

purchasing or upgrading equipment. This would tie into progression by giving another avenue of

advancement (gear improvements alongside level-ups). Currently, integration with loot is minimal

beyond “you get loot”, so fleshing out item progression (perhaps in a separate inventory/equipment

module) would fill that gap. On the whole, though, the leveling and power progression are well-

integrated – characters become stronger in stats and skills, and the narrative power systems scale

accordingly to maintain the anime flavor (power creep with purpose).

Dice Mechanics & Resolution

•

Transparent RNG Protocol:  AIDM v2 enforces a  strict dice-rolling transparency  rule to maintain

trust and fairness. All random outcomes are explicitly rolled and shown to the players in a standard

format. The dice module prohibits the LLM from “faking” a random result; instead it must declare the

roll, show the dice notation, generate an outcome, and display the calculation

44

. For example, the

GM will say “Attack roll: 1d20+5”, then show something like “[Rolling 1d20…] 14 → Total 19 vs Defense 16

45

[HIT]”

. This protocol (declare → roll → math → outcome) is mandatory for  every roll
designed to prevent AI hallucination of dice and ensure verifiability – an essential given an AI GM

. It’s

44

cannot truly generate randomness on its own. The module even states this is to counter the problem

of LLMs otherwise “mentally simulating” rolls in a possibly biased way

46

. The solution is effectively

a  dice roller within the narrative. If an actual random plugin or external roller is available, the

system can use it; if not, it can prompt the player to roll or use a deterministic pseudo-random seed

as a fallback

47

. This is a strong design choice to maintain player trust – they always see how a

5

result was obtained, including raw dice and modifiers

48

. Our audit finds this approach appropriate

and well-implemented (the examples given are clear). We should verify that the AI never deviates

from this format, even in intense narrative moments, because hiding a bad roll “for the story” is

explicitly disallowed

49

. Encouragingly, the common mistakes section reinforces not to fudge rolls

or omit the math

49

. In summary, the RNG protocol is  robust and player-facing, turning what

could be a black-box AI decision into a collaborative, open process.

•

Attack, Skill Checks, and Saves:  The dice system covers all major roll types with standard d20-

based mechanics. Attack rolls are 1d20 + relevant attack stat (STR/DEX for physical, INT for magic,

etc) + proficiency or skill bonuses, compared against the target’s Defense (like AC)

50

. Skill checks

are   1d20   +   skill   bonus   +   attribute,   compared   to   a   Difficulty   Class   (DC)

51

.  Saving   throws  (like

dodging a fireball or resisting poison) are also 1d20 + attribute (and maybe a save proficiency) vs a

DC

52

. All these follow the D&D-like paradigm, which is a sensible choice for a broad system – it’s a

familiar baseline and interacts well with the stat and skill system. The module provides plentiful

examples: e.g. a Persuasion check  “1d20+9 → total 20 vs DC 18 [SUCCESS]”  shows even situational
. Damage rolls use the appropriate dice (weapons have
modifiers like NPC affinity are included

51

fixed dice, spells have dice pools) plus modifiers, and each die result is shown individually for clarity

53

55

54

. Notably, the output explicitly updates HP values (e.g.  “Goblin HP 22→13”) in the narrative
, which is great for players to track combat state. Critical hits and fumbles are handled simply:

a   natural   20   on   a   d20   is   an   automatic   hit   and   typically   doubles   damage   dice

56

  (the   example:

normal 2d6+5 becomes 4d6+5 on a crit

56

), while a natural 1 is an automatic miss with a minor

consequence

57

  (e.g. lose balance or drop a weapon, but not catastrophic self-injury by default).

This is explicitly shown in examples (“[NAT 20!]… [CRIT HIT!]” vs “[NAT 1!]… [CRIT MISS!]”)

58

. The minor

fail   consequences   (like   “off-balance:   next   attack   at   disadvantage”

59

)   fit   genre-wise   –   enough   to

make   failures   dramatic   without   immediately   killing   the   fun.   The   consistency   and   clarity   of   these

mechanics is commendable. One thing to highlight: bounded accuracy again – attack bonuses won’t

outscale the d20, so the range of possible outcomes stays broad. We should also mention that the

system supports  opposed rolls  for contests (like grappling or stealth vs perception) by rolling for

both   sides   and   comparing

12

.   This   covers   things   like   tug-of-war   or   chase   scenes   in   mechanical

terms. All of these dice mechanisms align with the goal of transparent, RPG-standard resolution. We

find no major gaps here; the only extension might be offering alternate resolution mechanics for

groups who prefer non-d20 systems (see below).

•

Advantage,   Disadvantage,   and   Special   Dice   Systems:  The   system   incorporates  advantage/

disadvantage mechanics (rolling 2d20 and taking the higher or lower) for situational modifiers

11

.

Many   common   causes   are   given:   e.g.   flanking   or   a   target   being   prone   gives   Advantage   to   the

attacker, whereas the attacker being blinded or at long range gives Disadvantage

11

. The provided

example shows the GM explicitly rolling twice and highlighting which result is kept

11

. This is a

modern mechanic that adds tactical nuance and is easier to manage than trying to stack lots of +/-

modifiers.  It’s  good  to  see  it  included  and  clearly  explained.  The  dice  module  does  not  explicitly

mention   Fate/Fudge   dice   or   narrative   dice   pools   (like   those   in   Genesys   or   Powered   by   the

Apocalypse) – it’s squarely a d20 system with occasional d100s. The audit prompt asked about fate/

fudge   compatibility:  currently,   the   system   doesn’t   support   non-numeric   “narrative”   dice

symbols or 4dF  by default. It’s something to consider if a GM wanted a more narrative resolution

system; however, AIDM’s design leans crunchier. That said, the framework has a “Narrative” combat

mode  for predetermined outcomes or story-driven resolution

60

, which could emulate narrative-

focused systems by essentially bypassing dice when dramatically appropriate. For example, the rules

6

allow declaring an unwinnable story encounter that is resolved via narration rather than turn-by-turn

rolls

61

. This is a nod toward fate-style “the outcome is decided by story” approaches, but it’s used

sparingly (only when  drama trumps mechanics  like a scripted loss or trivial win)

60

. So while Fate/

Fudge   dice   aren’t   natively   implemented   (no   +/−   symbols   or   success-counting   mechanism   is
described), the system does provide tools to go fully narrative when needed. Recommendation: If

Fate   or   other   narrative   dice   systems   were   desired,   one   could   create   an   extension   module   (e.g.

interpret 4dF rolls or use the d20 as a fate ladder result). Given the current scope, it’s not a critical

omission   –   the   chosen   dice   mechanics   are   appropriate   for   the   granular   JRPG   style   targeted.   In

summary,   dice   resolution   in   AIDM   v2   is  comprehensive,   fair,   and   clearly   communicated,   with

advantage/disadvantage   enhancing   the   tactical   feel.   The   absence   of   Fate   dice   is   only   relevant   if

aiming   for   a   very   different   RPG   style;   for   anime   JRPG,   the   d20   approach   is   sufficient   and   well-

implemented.

Genre Fidelity & Anime Integration

•

Narrative   Profiles   Influence   Combat   Narration:  A   standout   feature   of   AIDM   is   the  Narrative

Profile system, which tailors the tone and style of narration (including combat) to specific anime

genres/series.
combat_narrative_style   settings

  Before   narrating   any   battle,

  the   GM   checks   the   active   profile’s

62

. These settings include a  strategy vs. spectacle slider,

whether characters should explain their powers mid-fight, whether  “sakuga” moments  (dramatic

slow-motion, visual flair) are emphasized, and if attack names are called out like in anime

5

. This

ensures that, say, a fight in a Hunter x Hunter-inspired game is described with meticulous tactical
analysis and Nen power explanations, whereas a Dragon Ball Z-style fight might focus on explosive

spectacle and shouted attack names. The combat module gives clear examples: with a high strategy

profile (HxH), the narration details characters analyzing and planning (“Gon feints… enemy’s aura

flickers   at   damage   threshold…   follow-up   attack   planned”)

63

64

,   whereas   a   low-strategy,   high-

spectacle profile (e.g. DanDaDan or a parody like  One Punch Man) would emphasize fast, chaotic

action   and   flashy   descriptions   over   tactical   detail

63

.   The   system   explicitly   labels  wrong   vs   right

examples   of   narration   to   drive   this   home   (e.g.  DanDaDan  should   be   chaotic   and   not   overly

analytical,  Attack on Titan  should feel desperate and brutal, etc.)

65

. This dynamic adjustment is

excellent   for   genre   fidelity   –   it   prevents   a   one-note   narration   style.   Our   examination   of   specific

profiles   confirms   this:   the  Hunter   x   Hunter   profile  indeed   prioritizes   deep   strategic   narration

(internal monologues, exhaustive explanation of ability mechanics)

66

67

, and the Jujutsu Kaisen

profile mixes horror and action with mid-battle philosophy and dark tone shifts

68

69

. Because the

combat   engine   references   these   profile   parameters   at   runtime,   the   resulting   narration   should

closely mimic the source material’s feel. This system appears to be working as intended, though it

relies on the profiles being well-crafted (which they are, from our sampling). It essentially gives the

AI a style guide for combat narrative, which is a clever way to enforce genre authenticity.

•

Power Systems Are Context-Sensitive: AIDM v2 includes modular power system libraries (Mana/

Magic, Ki/Chi, Soul/Spirit, Psionic, etc.) that reflect how supernatural abilities function in different

anime universes. These are integrated such that the campaign’s chosen power system influences

mechanics and descriptions. For example, if the world uses the  “Cursed Energy” system from

Jujutsu  Kaisen,  the  Soul/Spirit  library   outlines  how   negative   emotions   fuel   energy,  how   Domain

Expansions work as guaranteed-hit arenas, and how binding vows impose limits for greater power

70

. The GM will narrate and mechanically handle things differently than in a Ki-based Dragon Ball

scenario. We saw that each library defines core mechanics and even  specific techniques/tropes

7

from  its  inspiration,  which  the  AI  can  draw  on.  They  also  include  integration  rules  for  mixing

systems (e.g. a setting with both Mana and Ki users, or Bleach’s spiritual power overlapping with

physical Ki)

71

72

  – and they advise establishing these boundaries in Session 0 so the AI knows

which rules to apply. In practice, this means the system is quite context-sensitive: if you’re running

a One Piece-esque game, the GM knows about Haki’s mechanics and will narrate encounters with

Haki   (Observation,   Armament,   Conqueror)   in   mind

21

73

;   in   a   Naruto-like   game,   the   elemental

chakra   natures   and   combination   techniques   will   come   into   play

74

.   This   ensures   that   combat

narration   and   outcomes   feel  authentic   to   the   anime   world   chosen.   It’s   not   just   flavor   text   –   real

mechanics are provided (e.g. spending Ki for a Kamehameha or invoking a Nen vow for extra power

with a risk

75

76

). We find this integration impressive. The main challenge is on the AI to correctly

use the appropriate library at the right time (the loader mentions lazy-loading these when needed).

The design has accounted for a lot of popular shonen power tropes, and by having them as data

references, the GM can seamlessly weave them into combat. For instance, the GM can narratively

recognize a  “Domain Expansion”  and apply its effect (guaranteed hits inside the domain) per the

library

77

, or describe a “Bankai” as a phase change that multiplies power

78

. As a result, players

who expect genre staples will see them realized mechanically. We don’t see notable gaps in the
provided   power   systems   –   they   cover   a   wide   range   (magic,   ki,   spiritual,   psychic,   plus   a   generic

“unique” and “power scaling” reference). Perhaps  Quirks (My Hero Academia)  are not a separate

library but those can be handled with a combination of stat quirks and the Unique/Hybrid system.

Overall, the system’s awareness of context and ability to adapt rules/narration to it is a strong point.

•

Anime Pacing and Tropes in Mechanics:  The system is tuned to emulate anime conventions in

pacing and structure. Battles are meant to be dramatic climaxes – the inclusion of sakuga toggles

means   the   GM   will   deliberately   slow   down   and   highlight   big   moments   (e.g.   a   finishing   move

described in loving detail with slow-motion)

5

79

. This matches how anime fights often reserve

special   animation   for   critical   moments.   The   progression   system   also   mirrors  “power   creep”  in   a

controlled  way:  characters  do  get  significantly  stronger   over   arcs,  but   always  with  effort   or  cost

(earned XP, training for skills, etc.), much like protagonists training between sagas. The Tournament

Arc  trope   is   acknowledged,   as   mentioned   –   while   there’s   no   special   mechanic,   the   narrative

calibration   would   likely   structure   a   series   of   1v1   battles   with   escalating   difficulty   and   perhaps

between-match roleplay, exactly as seen in anime. The profile cross-reference even suggests using

certain profiles to capture the tournament vibe

80

15

. Another example: training montages – the

HxH   profile   explicitly   encourages   dedicating   sessions   to   training   and   strategy   planning   (it   cites

Heaven’s Arena episodes which are essentially training arcs)

66

81

. While not a coded mechanic,

the GM guidance is to allow training/downtime to be part of the story (and presumably reward it

with skill XP or narrative payoff). The  “sakuga” moments  parameter, if ON, ensures that at least

once per fight the GM will narrate an attack or scene with extra epic flair

5

  – this is brilliant for

delivering the emotional highs expected in anime battles. Additionally,  escalation  is built-in (boss

phases,   power-ups   mid-fight,   etc.)

8

  which   replicates   the   common   arc   of   “villain   gets   serious

halfway through” or “hero unleashes a hidden reserve at the climax.” The pacing of combat rounds (6

seconds)   is   standard,   but   narratively   the   GM   can   expand   those   seconds   into   entire   episodes   if

needed (as anime often does during intense fights). The Emotional stakes are also addressed: the

Victory/Defeat narration guidelines stress showing exhaustion, triumph, or despair rather than just

saying “you win”

82

83

. This aligns with anime where the aftermath of a battle is often as important

as the battle itself. In summary, AIDM v2’s combat and progression systems aren’t just mechanically

solid – they are  deliberately shaped by anime storytelling tropes. The result should be combats

that feel like scenes from an anime, complete with named special moves, dramatic power-ups, mid-

8

battle monologues, environmental carnage, and emotional rollercoasters. Our audit finds that genre

fidelity is a core strength of this system.

Missing Mechanics & Recommendations

Despite the robust framework, we identified a few areas where mechanics are under-defined or could be

expanded for completeness:

•

Knockout, Death, and Lasting Injuries:  The system lacks explicit rules for what happens when a

character   hits   0   HP   or   below.   The   combat   quick   reference   mentions   checking   for   injuries   after

combat

84

, implying there might be lingering wounds, but no specific injury table or condition is

provided. There is also no mention of death saving throws or stabilization mechanics (common in

systems like D&D to handle dying characters). Recommendation: Introduce a KO/dying mechanic –

for example, when a character falls to 0 HP, they could be “Downed” (unconscious) and start making

saving throws each round to avoid death, or perhaps impose an injury penalty if they survive. An

injury table could add gritty realism: e.g. if someone takes massive damage or drops below 0, roll

for  a  lasting  injury  (broken  arm,  scar,  etc.)  that  imposes  a  temporary  or  permanent  debuff  until

healed. This would raise the stakes of combat in line with many anime where injuries carry over

(think My Hero Academia where using powers too much breaks bones, or Attack on Titan where

injuries can cost limbs). It would also mesh with the narrative – the Victory/Defeat narration already

encourages describing injuries, so having mechanical weight behind that (like “your leg is injured,

-10ft movement until healed”) would be natural. Additionally, clarifying death: is a character dead at

–HP equal to max, or instantly at 0? Currently it just says 0 HP = defeat; we suggest defining it as

unconscious at 0 and dead at a negative threshold, or using a death save system. This will help GMs

handle dramatic near-death moments more consistently.

•

Resurrection and Recovery Mechanics:  Related to death/KO, there’s no explicit rule for reviving

fallen characters. The progression system shows at very high skill mastery a resurrection ability can

exist (Life Transfer ultimate at skill level 10)

30

, but the core rules don’t discuss revival spells, items

(like   Phoenix   Downs),   or   other   resurrection   protocols.  Recommendation:  Include   guidelines   for

revival:   If   a   character   dies,   can   they   be   resurrected   via   special   means?   Anime   often   have

resurrection but with a cost (Dragon Balls requiring a quest, or a one-time magical item, etc.). The

game could incorporate a  “death consequence”  system – e.g. a player can be revived by an ally

within X rounds (maybe via a rare item or huge MP cost spell), or if truly dead, perhaps continue as a

ghost or require a story quest to bring back. Even a simple rule like “after combat, if any PCs died,

the party may spend a Fate point or similar resource to have them miraculously survive with a severe

injury” could work. Having this defined would prevent awkward moments where a beloved character

dies and the rules fall silent. In addition, healing and rest mechanics are only briefly touched (short

rest = restore 25% HP, etc.)

85

; these could be expanded with a full rest/healing section – including

how injuries heal over time, how many short rests are allowed, etc., to round out recovery.

•

Economy,   Gear,   and   Crafting:  As   noted,   the   system   currently   doesn’t   detail   currency   or   item

acquisition beyond suggesting loot drops. There’s no price lists, no inventory weight or gold, and no

crafting or item upgrade rules in the examined docs. While these might exist in another part of the

system (or be left to GM fiat), their absence is notable in a JRPG-inspired game, since loot and gear

progression are typically important. Recommendation: Develop a basic economy system: define a

currency (gold, yen, credits depending on setting) and give guidance on rewards from quests and

9

costs of common items (weapons, armor, potions). This could tie into the progression pacing (so that

by Level 5, characters can afford a tier 2 weapon, etc.). The stat framework hints at item effects on

stats

86

, so it would be logical to flesh out an item upgrade path (e.g. +1 weapons, legendary gear

with special abilities). Also, consider  crafting mechanics  for players who want to forge their own

gear or brew potions – maybe a skill check or a downtime activity that results in new items. For an

anime  feel,  one  could  include  crafting  tropes  (like  the  protagonist  forging  a  signature  sword,  or

collecting ingredients for a custom potion). Incorporating gear more deeply will enhance long-term

progression and make loot meaningful beyond narrative flavor. It also opens up another avenue for

build diversity, as certain builds might rely on specific equipment. If keeping it simple, even a one-

page reference of sample gear and effects would suffice.

•

Encounter   Design   &   Challenge   Guidance:  While   difficulty   guidelines   are   given

31

,   the   system

could offer GMs more tools to design balanced and varied encounters. For example, a  Challenge

Rating (CR) calculator or encounter budgeting formula (sum of enemy levels vs party level) could

be provided for precision. Also, rules for mixing enemy types, handling very large numbers of weak

enemies   (“mooks”),   or   environmental   challenges   in   encounters   could   be   expanded.
Recommendation: Include an Encounter Building appendix with examples: e.g. “For a party of 4 at

level 5, an easy fight is 4 enemies of level 3 or 2 enemies of level 5,” etc., drawn from the XP math.

This can also incorporate terrain and traps: advice on adding environmental elements (hazards that

require   saves,   cover   positions,   etc.)   to   make   fights   tactical.   Given   the   anime   angle,   guidance   on

creating “boss + minions” fights or multi-phase battles (which the boss section touches on) could

be elaborated. For instance, how to run a battle royale tournament round, or how to simulate an

army battle by grouping foes, would empower GMs further. In summary, a bit more  structured

encounter design support  would ensure balance and keep fights interesting as the game scales.

The pieces are mostly there, so this is about packaging them for ease of use.

•

Non-Combat   Advancement   &   Downtime:  The   game   does   award   XP   for   non-combat   actions

(roleplay, discovery, social milestones)

18

, but beyond XP and narrative consequences, there isn’t a

distinct system for advancing in non-combat areas. For example, relationships are mentioned (gain

100 XP for a relationship tier)

18

, but what does increasing a relationship tier do mechanically?

Similarly, no explicit system for  social links, reputation, or faction standing  is given, though the

narrative profiles and tropes emphasize those aspects.  Recommendation:  Introduce a lightweight

Social/Relationship mechanic, such as a reputation scale or bond level with key NPCs that can

grant bonuses (e.g. an ally might fight harder for you if your bond is high, or a faction might offer

resources at higher reputation). This could be tracked similarly to skills – e.g. relationship level 1–5 –

and   tied   to   narrative   events.   The   achievement   list   hints   at   this   (achievements   like   “Trusted”   or

“Devoted”   give   XP)

87

,   which   is   good,   but   more   tangible   effects   would   encourage   role-play.

Additionally, downtime activities (training, research, crafting, networking) could be given structure.

For instance, allow players to spend a week of downtime to train a skill (grant some skill XP or even a

bonus skill point) or to gather information (trigger a narrative clue). Anime often have time skips

where   characters   train   or   prepare   for   the   next   arc;   having   a   downtime   phase   with   mechanical

benefits   would   emulate   this.   The   system’s   Learning   Engine   might   already   support   remembering

these activities, but formalizing it ensures players are rewarded mechanically for investing in non-

combat development. In summary, bolstering the non-combat progression will round out the game

experience,   making   sure   it’s   not   only   combat   and   levels   that   matter   but   also   relationships   and

narrative growth.

10

•

Additional Combat Options (Maneuvers & Variants):  The core combat actions are fairly simple

(Attack, Skill, Item, Defend, Flee)

88

. Missing are explicit options for common combat maneuvers

like grappling, shoving, disarming, called shots, aiding another, etc. We saw in the dice section

that   contests   like   grappling   can   be   done   with   opposed   rolls,   so   the   capability   exists,   but   these

actions   aren’t   listed   under   Player   Actions.  Recommendation:  Enumerate   some  special   combat

maneuvers  to  encourage  tactical  creativity.   For   example:  Grapple  (contest  STR   vs   STR   or  DEX  to

restrain a foe), Disarm (attack roll at disadvantage to knock a weapon away on a hit), Called Shot (take

–5 to hit for a specific targeted effect), Aid (use your action to give an ally Advantage on their next

attack   by   distracting   an   enemy).   Having   these   options   formally   available   expands   combat   depth

beyond “I hit or I cast a spell.” Many anime fights involve clever tactics like binding an opponent

(grappling), striking a weak point (called shot), or team combos (which the narration encourages via

the  TEAMWORK  narration   tag

89

  but   mechanics   don’t   explicitly   cover).   By   adding   a   few   simple

maneuvers, the system would incentivize players to emulate those clever tactics. This also synergizes

with the advantage system (e.g. two characters coordinate attacks to gain Advantage, essentially

what aiding would do).

•

Minor Miscellanies: Lastly, a few smaller recommendations: Provide a clear rule for critical damage

calculation (the quick ref shows double dice

56

, which is fine, just ensure it’s consistently applied to

all   rolls   including   skill   attacks).   Clarify   stacking   of   buffs/debuffs   (can   you   have   two   Strengthen

effects? Likely not, but worth stating). And consider a  “GM fiat” safety valve  in documentation:

since   an   AI   GM   runs   this,   explicitly   allow   the   GM   to   adjust   or   handwave   rules   if   dramatically

appropriate (the narrative combat section does this to an extent

60

). This is not a missing mechanic

per se, but a reminder that story comes first – which the system prompt does imply (“Combat is story

through conflict, not math”

90

). Reiterating that in the rules can empower the AI to occasionally

bend mechanics for the sake of genre (with player consent via meta prompts).

In conclusion, the AIDM v2 combat, progression, and dice systems are  comprehensive and well-aligned

with anime JRPG conventions. They exhibit a solid tactical foundation enhanced by narrative integration.

The few gaps identified (injury/death rules, economy, some advanced options) can be filled with relatively

straightforward   additions,   as   recommended   above.   Addressing   these   would   improve   the   system’s

completeness   and   resilience  in   campaign   play.   Overall,   the   design   shows   a   high   level   of   polish   and

understanding of both game mechanics and anime storytelling, achieving a dynamic balance between the

two.   With   minor   improvements,   AIDM   v2   will   not   only   be   mechanically   sound   and   engaging,   but   also

exceptionally faithful to the spirit of the anime worlds it aims to bring to life.
