3. Player chooses world setup (timeline, location, canon characters)
4. Player sets preferences (violence, combat complexity, pacing)
5. Player creates character (Lightning Style jonin/ANBU)
6. AIDM generates character sheet and opening scene
7. Validate playable within 10 exchanges

**Time**: 30-40 minutes  
**Coverage**: ~4,500 words

**Validates**:
- Power system harmonization (3 incompatible anime)

4. Combat test (use all 3 systems)
5. Edge case stress test (organizational structure, leveling rules)
6. Validate coherence and playability

**Example Fusion**:
- Quirks = genetic foundation (MHA)
- Chakra = trainable internal energy (Naruto)
- System = quantifies both, grants XP/leveling (Solo Leveling)
- All 3 coexist on unified character sheet

#### TEST-003: Session Persistence
**File**: `tests/test_scripts/TEST_3_SESSION_PERSISTENCE.md`  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Time**: 40-50 minutes  
**Coverage**: ~5,000 words

### 5. Remaining Test Scripts (To Be Created)

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (CRITICAL - Must Pass)

**Tests**: 1, 4, 6  
**Time**: ~1.5 hours  
**Rationale**: These validate basic playability

**Order**:
1. TEST-001 (Cold Start) - Can we create a character?
2. TEST-004 (Combat) - Can we fight?
3. TEST-006 (Error Recovery) - Can we correct mistakes?

**If any fail**: Fix immediately before proceeding (release blockers)

---

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (HIGH - Should Pass)

**Tests**: 2, 3, 5  
**Time**: ~2 hours  
**Rationale**: These validate sophisticated systems

**Order**:
1. TEST-002 (Multi-Anime Fusion) - Can we combine anime?
2. TEST-003 (Session Persistence) - Can we save/load?
3. TEST-005 (Memory Coherence) - Do NPCs remember?

**If any fail**: Acceptable if minor issues (can PARTIAL PASS)

---

### Phase 3: Quality & Polish (MEDIUM - Nice to Pass)

**Tests**: 7, 8  
**Time**: ~1.5 hours  
**Rationale**: These validate user experience quality

**Order**:
1. TEST-007 (Genre Adaptation) - Do genres feel authentic?
2. TEST-008 (Research Validation) - Does research avoid hallucination?

**If any fail**: Document limitations, not release blockers

## Current Testing Status

**Framework Status**: ✅ Complete and ready for execution

**Test Scripts**:
- Created: 3/8 (Tests 1, 2, 3)
- Remaining: 5/8 (Tests 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)

**Execution Status**:
- Executed: 0/8
- Passed: 0
- Failed: 0
- Pending: 8

**Next Immediate Action**:
1. **Option A**: Create remaining test scripts (Tests 4-8) before execution
2. **Option B**: Execute Tests 1-3 now (validate framework works)
3. **Option C**: Begin with TEST-001 (Cold Start) as pilot test

---

## Estimated Timeline

### If Creating All Scripts First (Option A)
- Remaining test scripts: ~2 hours
- Test execution (all 8): ~4-6 hours
- Issue fixing (if any): ~2-4 hours
- **Total**: 8-12 hours to full validation

### If Executing Immediately (Option B/C)
- Execute Tests 1-3: ~1.5-2 hours
- Create remaining scripts: ~2 hours  
- Execute Tests 4-8: ~2.5-4 hours
- Issue fixing: ~2-4 hours
- **Total**: 8-12 hours to full validation

**Recommendation**: Option B (execute 1-3 first) to validate framework design before investing in remaining scripts.

---

## Success Indicators

**Framework is successful if**:
1. Tests can be executed as written (procedures are clear)
2. Pass/fail criteria are objective (no ambiguity)
3. Issues are discoverable (tests catch real problems)
4. Results inform release decision (actionable data)

**Framework needs revision if**:
1. Test procedures are confusing or ambiguous
2. Pass/fail criteria are subjective or unclear
3. Tests don't catch actual problems
4. Results don't help decide "ship or not ship"

---

## Post-Testing Actions

### If Tests Pass
1. Update `docs/STATE.md` (mark testing complete)
2. Update `CONTINUE_HERE.md` (mark ready for release)
3. Create `RELEASE_NOTES.md`
4. Create deployment guide for users
5. **Ship AIDM v2.0!** 🚀

### If Tests Fail
1. Triage issues (CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW)
2. Fix CRITICAL issues (release blockers)
3. Fix HIGH issues (quality problems)
4. Re-run failed tests
5. Document any remaining limitations
6. Decide: Ship with caveats or delay for more fixes
