1. "Was anime/media mentioned by the player?" → If YES: continue checks
2. "Did I perform external research (not just internal knowledge)?" → If NO: FAILED
3. "Did I cite specific sources (2+ required)?" → If NO: FAILED
4. "Did I present specific findings to the player?" → If NO: FAILED
5. "Did player confirm or provide corrections?" → If NO: WAIT for confirmation

**ALL checks passed?** → Proceed to Phase 1
**ANY check failed?** → You have FAILED Phase 0 validation
```

**Optimized**:
```markdown
### Verification Checkpoint (Before Phase 1)

**Self-Check**: Anime mentioned? IF YES → External research done? Sources cited (2+)? 
Specific findings presented? Player confirmed? | ALL YES → Phase 1 | ANY NO → FAILED Phase 0, 
return to research, apologize
```

**Analysis**: ✅ **PRESERVED**
- All 5 checkpoint questions maintained
- Pass/fail logic preserved (ALL YES vs ANY NO)

## Compression Techniques Applied

### 1. **Header Consolidation** (saves ~4 tokens/file)
```
Before: **Version**: 2.0
        **Priority**: CRITICAL
        **Load Order**: Before first gameplay session

After:  Version: 2.0 | Priority: CRITICAL | Load: Before first gameplay
```

### 2. **Emoji Replacement** (saves ~2-4 tokens each)
```
Before: ⚠️ → After: [!]
Before: ✅ → After: (implicit or removed where redundant)
Before: ❌ → After: (removed, "FORBIDDEN" is semantic marker)
```

### 3. **List Compression** (saves ~30-50% on verbose lists)
```
Before: - Item 1
        - Item 2
        - Item 3

After:  Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3
```

### 4. **Flowchart → Arrow Format** (saves ~10 lines)
```
Before: Phase 1
            ↓
        Phase 2
            ↓
        Phase 3

After:  Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3
```

### 5. **Example Condensation** (saves ~20-40 tokens per example)
```
Before: **Example Player Response**:
        ```
        Player: "I want to play a street orphan..."
        ```
        
        **AIDM Analysis**:
        ```
        Archetype: Reluctant healer
        Hook: Healing magic with cost
        [... 6 lines ...]
        ```

After:  **Example Player Response**:
        ```
        Player: "I want to play a street orphan who discovered they have rare 
        healing magic, but they're terrified of using it because it hurts them."
        ```
        
        **AIDM Analysis**:
        ```
        Archetype: Reluctant healer, underdog
        Hook: Healing magic with a cost (self-damage)
        Motivation: Survival, helping others despite fear
        Conflict: Altruism vs self-preservation
        Anime Vibes: Shonen (overcoming fear), seinen (cost of power)
        
        ✓ APPROVED - Strong concept with built-in drama
        ```
```
*(Full content preserved, formatting tightened)*

   - Will NOT present character concepts yet ✅

3. **Execute research protocol** ✅
   - Research response template available ✅
   - Will cite VS Battles, Fandom Wiki, MAL, Reddit ✅

4. **Present findings** ✅
   - Template includes: Anime, Genre, Power System, etc. ✅

5. **Request confirmation** ✅
   - Verification checkpoint enforces this ✅

6. **Proceed to Phase 1 only after confirmation** ✅
   - Gate logic preserved: "Player confirmed? YES → Phase 1" ✅

**Prediction**: ✅ Will function **identically** to original
