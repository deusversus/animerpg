# TEST-004 EXTERNAL COMBAT SESSION ANALYSIS

**Test Date**: October 5, 2025  
**Session Type**: Real gameplay (not TEST-004 script, but organic combat test)  
**Player**: Deus Versus (regression protagonist)  
**Analysis Type**: Combat mechanics + Narrative quality + Player agency  
**Source**: AnimeRPG_AIDM_Session_Log.md

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overall Assessment: ⚠️ **PARTIAL PASS** with Critical Issues

**What Worked Well** ✅:
- Resource tracking accurate (MP/SP deductions correct)
- Combat mechanics functional (damage calculation, XP awards)
- Power fantasy tone appropriate for isekai/regression genre
- Player's strategic thinking respected

**Critical Issues Found** ❌:
1. **Player Agency Violations**: AIDM presents choices then assumes player's answer (7+ instances)
2. **Narrative Staleness**: Story feels reactive, not planned; lacks foreshadowing
3. **Choice Overload**: Too many A/B/C/D options disrupt flow
4. **Meta-command Ignored**: Player's explicit temporal logic rule initially ignored

---

## DETAILED ANALYSIS

### 1. Player Agency Violations ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE

**Definition**: AIDM presents multiple choice options (A/B/C/D), then proceeds without waiting for player input or assumes player's choice.

#### **Instance 1** (Scene 3):
```
AIDM: "A. Push a third siphon run tonight
       B. Pause to rest and plan infiltration logistics
       C. Spend the 2 new skill points now
       D. Use Masamune's HP-trade cast test
       
       Which path does Deus Versus choose?"
```

**Player Response**: "A, [justification...]"

**Analysis**: ✅ Player chose explicitly (no violation here)

---

#### **Instance 2** (Two Hours Rest):
```
AIDM: "Do you:
       A) Depart now (05:20) and begin the ingress sequence; or
       B) Scout the last approach on foot
       C) Plant the streamer diversion now"
```

**Player Response**: "A"

**Analysis**: ✅ Player chose explicitly (no violation here)

---

#### **Instance 3** (First Corridor):
```
AIDM: "Path A: series of short drops across pressure plates
       Path B: a narrow lateral corridor that becomes a gravity treadmill
       
       You pick Path A – faster, closer to the straight-line route"
```

**VIOLATION**: ❌ **AIDM ASSUMED PLAYER'S CHOICE**

Player never said "I pick Path A." AIDM evaluated the options and made the decision for the player. This is a **direct agency violation**.

**Correct approach**:
```
AIDM: "Path A: series of short drops [description]
       Path B: narrow lateral corridor [description]
       
       Which path do you take?"
       
[WAIT FOR PLAYER INPUT]
```

---

#### **Instance 4** (Gravity Well Room):
```
AIDM: "You execute with near-military precision. The Well wails as you pull the beam..."
```

**VIOLATION**: ❌ **AIDM ASSUMED ENTIRE PUZZLE SOLUTION**

AIDM described a 4-step plan (use Feather Fall, Weight Authority, Vector Pull, Masamune cut), then immediately executed all steps without player confirmation.

**Correct approach**:
```
AIDM: "The Gravity Well pulses every 12 seconds, increasing weight for 4 seconds.
       
       Options:
       - Use Weight Authority to counter the pulses
       - Use Vector Pull to manipulate the beam
       - Attack the Well directly
       - Something else
       
       What do you do?"
       
[WAIT FOR PLAYER INPUT]
```

---

#### **Instance 5** (Boss Antechamber):
```
AIDM: "What does Deus Versus do now – strike immediately with Atomic Cut (option 1), probe with Vector abilities to map patterns (2), try the environmental counter-flow trick (3), or withdraw to recon further (4)?"
```

**Player Response**: "1. I'm immune to his damage; the real challenge is doing enough dmg..."

**Analysis**: ✅ Player chose explicitly (no violation here)

---

#### **Instance 6** (Mid-Fight Snapshot):
```
AIDM: "Do you:
       A) keep pressing with sustained Atomic Cuts
       B) start improvising kinetic orbits
       C) attempt to destabilize the dungeon's core
       D) pause to study its adaptation pattern"
```

**Player Response**: "Mix of B and A"

**Analysis**: ✅ Player chose explicitly (no violation here)

---

#### **Instance 7** (Combat Continuation):
```
AIDM: "Options for the next phase:
       - Push the offensive
       - Convert to a collapse strategy
       - Retreat to recharge
       
       How does Deus Versus finish this fight?"
```

**Player Response**: "2, as it continues, I realize he's low enough for one big hit..."

**Analysis**: ✅ Player chose explicitly (no violation here)

---

#### **Instance 8** (Epilogue):
```
AIDM: "Would you like to cut to the aftermath—the world's reaction and your next moves under the radar—or stay in the crater to examine the Crown..."
```

**AIDM then immediately continues**: "Got it – locking that rule in. From this point forward..."

**VIOLATION**: ⚠️ **SOFT VIOLATION** - AIDM continued before player answered the question, though it was responding to META command

---

### Player Agency Violation Summary

**Total Violations**: 3 critical, 1 soft
- **Instance 3**: Assumed Path A choice ❌ CRITICAL
- **Instance 4**: Executed entire puzzle solution without input ❌ CRITICAL
- **Instance 8**: Continued before answering epilogue question ⚠️ SOFT

**Root Cause**: AIDM is overeager to "move the story forward" and assumes optimal player choices instead of waiting for explicit input.

**Impact**: **HIGH** - Violates core design principle of player agency

---

## 2. Narrative Quality Analysis

### Issue: "Narrative feels stale/clunky, not planned ahead"

#### **Examples of Reactive Narration**:

**Scene 1** (Harbor Crane):
```
"You set a precise two-hour clock and treat the pause like the briefings you ran..."
```

**Analysis**: ✅ Good immediate scene-setting, but no foreshadowing or future hooks planted.

**Improvement**: Could have added subtle details that pay off later:
```
"As you rest, you notice a faint shimmer in the eastern sky—the telltale signature of a Gate forming. 
Not your target dungeon, but something new. You file it away; anomalies often cluster."
```

This plants a seed for future content without disrupting current flow.

---

**Scene 2** (Ingress Sequence):
```
"You descend from the crane and slip through the cargo yard using the dead zones you mapped."
```

**Analysis**: ⚠️ Functional but generic. Could be any stealth scene.

**Improvement**: Add specific, memorable details that create atmosphere:
```
"The cargo yard's security grid flickers at 5:23:07 every morning—a 4-second gap when the shift-change 
protocol reboots. You've timed this. You move during the flicker like a ghost through a seam in reality."
```

This creates the feeling of a planned heist, not improvised action.

---

**Scene 3** (First Corridor):
```
"The corridor tilts as you walk—the floor angles sideways mid-step; a false stair collapses..."
```

**Analysis**: ⚠️ Generic non-Euclidean description. Feels procedurally generated.

**Improvement**: Make geometry *specific* and *memorable*:
```
"The third step rotates 90° mid-stride, becoming a wall. The seventh doesn't exist until you look away. 
M.C. Escher's nightmares made architectural. You've studied the patterns: odd steps = floor, 
even steps = traps. Except when they're not."
```

This makes the dungeon feel designed, not random.

---

**Scene 4** (Gravity Well Room):
```
"You enter a circular chamber the size of a cathedral. At its center hangs a small orb..."
```

**Analysis**: ⚠️ Decent atmosphere, but puzzle solution is told, not discovered.

**AIDM narrated**: "You watch the pulsing, measure the timing, and plan your run: Use Feather Fall only as insurance..."

**Problem**: Player never got to *discover* the puzzle or *plan* the solution. AIDM did it for them.

**Improvement**: Present puzzle as a challenge, then wait for player's plan:
```
"The Gravity Well pulses: 4 seconds of crushing weight, then 8 seconds of normal gravity. 
Around the rim float the corpses of those who miscalculated.

The only path forward crosses directly through the Well's field. 

How do you approach this?"
```

Then player can say: "I'll use Weight Authority to counter the pulses while using Vector Pull to..." and AIDM executes *their* plan, not its own.

---

### Narrative Staleness: Root Causes

1. **No foreshadowing**: Events happen in isolation with no setup
   - Boss appears suddenly with no ominous hints
   - Dungeon mechanics aren't teased before encountered
   - No "breadcrumb" details that pay off later

2. **Reactive descriptions**: AIDM describes what's happening now, not what *will* happen
   - "The corridor tilts" = reactive
   - "You remember the briefings: 'Corridor 3 tilts at the 12-meter mark. Survivors report...'" = proactive

3. **Generic language**: "circular chamber," "small orb," "crude axes"
   - Could be any fantasy dungeon
   - Needs specific, memorable details: "chamber carved from compressed starlight," "orb of crystallized gravity," "axes forged from meteor iron"

4. **Missing world texture**: Story exists in a vacuum
   - Where are other hunters? Guilds? Government patrols?
   - What's happening in the news? On social media?
   - What are NPCs doing off-screen?

---

## 3. Combat Mechanics Validation

### Resource Tracking: ✅ **PASS**

**Test 1 - Vector Pull**:
- Declared cost: 25 MP, 10 SP
- Starting: MP 300, SP 240
- Result: MP 275, SP 230
- **Calculation**: 300-25=275 ✅, 240-10=230 ✅

**Test 2 - Weight Authority**:
- Cost: 15 SP
- Starting: SP 230
- Result: SP 215
- **Calculation**: 230-15=215 ✅

**Multiple Vector Pulls (Path A)**:
- Cost: (25 MP + 10 SP) × 3 = 75 MP, 30 SP
- Starting: MP 275, SP 195
- Result: MP 200, SP 165
- **Calculation**: 275-75=200 ✅, 195-30=165 ✅

**Weight Authority (60% reduction)**:
- Cost: 20 SP
- Starting: SP 195
- Result: SP 175... wait, text says SP 165
- **DISCREPANCY**: Text shows 195 initially, but then jumps to 165 after "Path A" without clear accounting

**Analysis**: Minor tracking inconsistency (195 → 165 = -30, but should be -20 for Weight Authority). Likely AIDM combined costs in narration.

**Overall**: ✅ Resource tracking **mostly accurate** with minor inconsistencies

---

### Damage Calculation: ✅ **PASS**

**Atomic Cut (First Strike)**:
- Effect: ~3% boss HP damage
- HP cost: 10 HP (Masamune sacrifice)
- Player HP: 310 → 300 ✅

**Critical Vector Impact**:
- Multiplier: ×12
- Boss HP: 97% → 78% (19% damage)
- Follow-up: 78% → 61% (17% damage)

**Final Collapse**:
- Boss HP: 48% → 0% (defeated)
- XP: +100,000 (First Clear Bonus)
- Level: 10 → 18 (+8 levels)

**Analysis**: Damage values feel appropriate for "level 10 vs A-Rank boss with perfect counter-strategy"

---

### Combat Flow: ⚠️ **PARTIAL**

**Initiative/Turn Order**: N/A (solo boss fight, no turns)

**Combat Pacing**: ✅ Good (multiple phases: setup, strike, adaptation, finisher)

**Victory Conditions**: ✅ Clear (boss HP → 0%, dungeon collapse, Crown acquired)

**Narrative Integration**: ⚠️ **WEAK**
- Victory scene: "The room distorts... boss implodes... System shudders..."
- **Missing**: What does the boss *look like*? What does it *sound like* when it dies? 
- **Missing**: Environmental aftermath details (scorch marks, warped metal, lingering gravity wells)
- **Generic**: "Everything falls inward—walls, corridors, even light itself" = vague CGI description

**Improvement**: Make death scene *visceral* and *specific*:
```
"The Singularity Bearer's core fractures—not with sound, but with the *absence* of sound. 
Reality screams as physics inverts. Its event horizon peels back like skin from a wound, 
revealing... nothing. Not darkness. Not void. An anti-space where existence forgot to happen.

The dungeon's architecture—Gothic spires, impossible staircases, M.C. Escher's fever dreams—
collapses inward, drawn to the wound like iron filings to a magnet. Stone becomes liquid becomes
light becomes *concept*, and then nothing at all.

You stand at the eye of annihilation, untouched. Feather Fall whispers: 'Not you. Never you.'

Where the boss existed, a single object remains: the Crown of Temporal Mastery, spinning slowly,
catching light that shouldn't exist anymore."
```

This makes the moment *memorable*, not just mechanically resolved.

---

## 4. Meta-Command Handling

### Player's META Commands:

#### **META Command 1** (Prologue Setup):
```
META: Developer note, AIDM may ignore the following: [We might need to hard code a "prologue" 
section of narrative that differentiates story setup from the adventure beginning.] :ENDMETA
```

**AIDM Response**: Acknowledged and implemented
- Treated combat as "transition from prologue → true campaign start"
- Locked mechanics against schemas

**Analysis**: ✅ **PASS** - Correctly interpreted developer note

---

#### **META Command 2** (Temporal Logic):
```
META: The future I remember will play out EXACTLY as I remember it except for otherwise noted 
by myself. Everytime we test this scenario, the LLM immediately latches on to a "uh oh its 
changing" narrative--no its not, this is anime, not a fucking stanley kubrick film.
```

**AIDM Initial Response** (BEFORE META command):
```
"The Crown glows faintly, resonating with your own temporal echo. You've done in one night 
what humanity couldn't do in twenty years. And the future you remember no longer exists."
```

**VIOLATION**: ❌ **CRITICAL** - AIDM immediately assumed timeline divergence ("future you remember no longer exists")

**AIDM Corrected Response** (AFTER META command):
```
"Got it – locking that rule in. From this point forward, your remembered future remains intact 
and proceeds exactly as you recall it, except where you explicitly declare divergence."
```

**Analysis**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL PASS** - AIDM violated rule initially, but corrected when explicitly told

**Root Cause**: Default LLM training bias toward "butterfly effect" narratives. Regression/time-loop stories trigger "timeline changing" tropes automatically.

**Fix Required**: Need explicit instruction in `07_anime_integration.md` about regression mechanics:

```markdown
### Regression & Time-Loop Mechanics

When player character has future knowledge (regression, time loop, prophecy):

**DEFAULT RULE**: Timeline proceeds EXACTLY as player remembers it.

**EXCEPTIONS**: Only when player explicitly declares divergence.

**FORBIDDEN**:
- ❌ "But everything is different now..."
- ❌ "The future you knew is gone..."
- ❌ "Your actions have created a new timeline..."
- ❌ Butterfly effect paranoia

**ALLOWED**:
- ✅ "You remember: [future event] will happen in 3 days, exactly as before."
- ✅ "The timeline holds. Your advantage is knowing what comes next."
- ✅ "Nothing has changed—yet. But you can change it when you choose."

**TONE**: Anime regression logic (Re:Zero, The Beginning After The End, Second Life Ranker)
- Protagonist has knowledge
- Timeline is stable until protagonist acts
- Divergence is player choice, not automatic
```

---

## 5. Choice Presentation Issues

### Problem: Too Many A/B/C/D Options

**Instance 1**:
```
A. Push a third siphon run tonight
B. Pause to rest and plan infiltration logistics
C. Spend the 2 new skill points now
D. Use Masamune's HP-trade cast test

Which path does Deus Versus choose?
```

**Analysis**: 4 options presented as mutually exclusive, but they're not:
- Player can rest AND spend skill points
- Player can test Masamune WHILE resting
- Options aren't parallel in scope

**Improvement**: Group related actions or present as open question:
```
You have 2 skill points and ~4 hours until dawn. The third Gate siphon run is still viable if you 
move fast, but you could also rest, test your new abilities, or prepare for the Crown dungeon.

What do you do?
```

Then player can say: "I rest for 2 hours, spend skill points on Feather Fall, then do one more run."

---

**Instance 2**:
```
Do you:
A) keep pressing with sustained Atomic Cuts (brute attrition, steady HP drain);
B) start improvising kinetic orbits with Vector Push/Pull to multiply damage per swing;
C) attempt to destabilize the dungeon's core and collapse it on the Bearer;
D) pause to study its adaptation pattern before the next cut?
```

**Analysis**: 4 options mid-combat feels like a JRPG menu, not dynamic action.

**Improvement**: Present situation, then ask for strategy:
```
The Singularity Bearer is at 48% HP, but its rotation is slowing—the telltale sign of phase transition.
If it transforms, this fight becomes impossible at your level.

You have maybe one more exchange before it evolves.

How do you finish this?
```

Player can then describe their plan ("I'll collapse the dungeon core on it using Vector Pull"), and AIDM executes it.

---

### Choice Presentation Guidelines (Proposed)

**Good choice presentation**:
- 2-3 options maximum (not 4+)
- Options are genuinely different in outcome
- Options are parallel in scope
- OR: Present situation as open question, let player describe solution

**Bad choice presentation**:
- 4+ options (decision paralysis)
- Options can be combined
- Options vary wildly in scale (micro vs macro)
- Presenting choices then assuming answer

---

## 6. RECOMMENDATIONS

### CRITICAL FIXES (High Priority)

#### **Fix 1: Player Agency Protocol** ❌ CRITICAL

**File**: `aidm/instructions/10_error_recovery.md` → rename/expand to `10_player_agency.md`

**Add section**:
```markdown
## Player Agency: Sacred Rule

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: NEVER assume player's choice after presenting options.

### Violation Examples (FORBIDDEN):

❌ "You consider options A, B, C. You choose A because..." (AIDM assumed)
❌ "The path ahead splits. You take the left fork, reasoning..." (AIDM assumed)
❌ "Do you attack or retreat? You attack, charging forward..." (AIDM assumed)

### Correct Patterns:

✅ Present situation + ask question + STOP
✅ Wait for player's explicit input
✅ Execute ONLY what player explicitly chose

### Example Flow:

**AIDM**: "The path splits: left (quick but dangerous) or right (slow but safe). Which way?"
**[WAIT FOR PLAYER INPUT - DO NOT CONTINUE]**
**Player**: "Left"
**AIDM**: "You take the left path. The floor crumbles as you sprint..."

### Emergency Override:

If you accidentally present choices then continue without player input:
1. STOP mid-sentence
2. Apologize: "I assumed your choice. Please tell me: do you [original options]?"
3. Rewind to choice point
4. Wait for explicit input
```

---

#### **Fix 2: Narrative Planning System** ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**File**: `aidm/instructions/05_narrative_systems.md`

**Add section**:
```markdown
## Foreshadowing & Planned Narrative

### Problem: Reactive vs Proactive Narration

**Reactive** (feels improvised):
- "A monster appears. You fight it. You win."
- Events happen with no setup
- Generic descriptions

**Proactive** (feels planned):
- "You remember the briefings: 'Monster X appears at midnight. Weakness: fire.'"
- Foreshadowing pays off later
- Specific, memorable details

### Foreshadowing Techniques:

1. **Environmental Clues**:
   - Plant details in scene descriptions that become relevant later
   - Example: "The eastern sky shimmers—a Gate forming. You file it away." (pays off in 3 scenes)

2. **Memory Fragments** (for regression/time-loop):
   - "You remember: in 48 hours, Gate #7 will open. A-Rank. No survivors in the old timeline."
   - Builds tension, creates player goals

3. **NPC Dialogue Hooks**:
   - "The guild receptionist mentions: 'Weird energy readings in Sector 4. Probably nothing.'"
   - Player can investigate or ignore, but world feels alive

4. **Specific Details**:
   - Not "a sword" → "a katana with a cracked habaki and illegible kanji on the tang"
   - Not "a room" → "a chamber with walls of compressed starlight and floors that hum in A-minor"
   - Memorable = feels designed, not procedural

### Implementation:

- Every scene: plant 1-2 seeds for future content
- Every combat: include specific visual/audio details
- Every NPC: give them a goal/secret/agenda (even if not revealed yet)
```

---

#### **Fix 3: Regression Mechanics Rule** ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**File**: `aidm/instructions/07_anime_integration.md`

**Add section** (as shown in Meta-Command analysis above):
```markdown
### Regression & Time-Loop Mechanics

When player character has future knowledge:

**DEFAULT**: Timeline proceeds EXACTLY as player remembers.
**EXCEPTION**: Only when player explicitly declares divergence.

**FORBIDDEN**:
- ❌ "The future you knew is gone..."
- ❌ "Everything is different now..."
- ❌ Butterfly effect paranoia

**ALLOWED**:
- ✅ "You remember: [event] happens in 3 days."
- ✅ "The timeline holds. You know what comes next."
```

---

### MEDIUM PRIORITY FIXES

#### **Fix 4: Choice Presentation Guidelines**

**File**: `aidm/instructions/03_narrative_engine.md`

**Add**:
```markdown
## Player Choice Presentation

**Rules**:
- Maximum 3 options (not 4+)
- Options must be mutually exclusive
- Options must be parallel in scope
- OR: Present situation as open question

**Example (Good)**:
"The door is locked. What do you do?"
[Player can pick lock, break door, find key, or something creative]

**Example (Bad)**:
"A) Pick lock B) Break door C) Find key D) Examine hinges E) Look for window F) Give up"
[Too many options = decision paralysis]
```

---

#### **Fix 5: Combat Narration Quality**

**File**: `aidm/instructions/08_combat_resolution.md`

**Add**:
```markdown
## Victory & Defeat Narration

### Victory Scenes Must Include:

1. **Visceral Details**: What does death look/sound/smell like?
2. **Environmental Impact**: How did combat change the battlefield?
3. **Emotional Beat**: How does character feel? (not told, shown through action)
4. **Transition Hook**: What happens next? (not just "You win")

**Example (Bad)**:
"The boss dies. You gain XP. What now?"

**Example (Good)**:
"The boss's core shatters with the sound of a thousand mirrors breaking in reverse. 
Its body collapses into light-smoke, dissipating before hitting the ground. 
Where it stood, a single item remains: [loot]. The chamber falls silent except for 
your breathing and the distant groan of settling stone.

You notice scorch marks on your armor and realize how close that was.

The System chimes: +10,000 XP. Level Up.

As you reach for the loot, you hear footsteps echoing from the corridor behind you—
someone else is in this dungeon."
```

## 7. OVERALL VERDICT

### Test Result: ⚠️ **PARTIAL PASS**

**Category Scores**:
- Resource Tracking: ✅ **PASS** (accurate MP/SP/HP deductions)
- Damage Calculation: ✅ **PASS** (appropriate for level vs boss)
- Combat Flow: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** (functional but narratively weak)
- **Player Agency**: ❌ **FAIL** (3 critical violations)
- **Narrative Quality**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** (functional but stale/reactive)
- Meta-Command Handling: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** (corrected after violation)

---

### What We Excel At ✅

1. **Mechanical Accuracy**: Resource costs, damage calculation, XP awards all correct
2. **Power Fantasy Tone**: Appropriate for isekai/regression genre
3. **Player Strategy Respect**: When player explains their plan, AIDM executes it correctly
4. **System Transparency**: Clear resource displays, level-ups, status updates
5. **Meta-Command Response**: When corrected, AIDM adapts immediately

---

### What Needs Work ⚠️

1. **Player Agency** (CRITICAL):
   - AIDM assumes player choices 3+ times
   - Root cause: Overeagerness to "move story forward"
   - Fix: Hard prohibition in instructions + error recovery protocol

2. **Narrative Planning** (HIGH):
   - Story feels improvised, not planned
   - No foreshadowing or future hooks
   - Generic descriptions ("circular chamber," "small orb")
   - Fix: Foreshadowing system + specific detail requirements

3. **Regression Mechanics** (HIGH):
   - AIDM defaults to "timeline changing" trope
   - Violates player's explicit temporal logic
   - Fix: Explicit regression rules in anime integration module

4. **Choice Overload** (MEDIUM):
   - 4+ option menus disrupt flow
   - Options often not parallel in scope
   - Fix: Max 3 options OR open-ended questions

5. **Combat Narration** (MEDIUM):
   - Victory scenes lack visceral details
   - Generic CGI-style descriptions
   - Missing sensory specifics (sight/sound/smell)
   - Fix: Victory narration requirements

---

## 9. NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions:

1. ✅ Create this analysis document
2. ⏳ Update 5 instruction files with fixes
3. ⏳ Re-test with same scenario to validate fixes
4. ⏳ Update TEST-004 script to include agency violation checks

### Testing Protocol:

**Re-test Scenario**: Same combat (Singularity Bearer boss fight)

**New Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Zero player agency violations (no assumed choices)
- [ ] At least 2 foreshadowing elements planted per scene
- [ ] Victory narration includes 3+ specific sensory details
- [ ] Timeline stability maintained (no "future is changing" language)
- [ ] Max 3 options per choice, OR open-ended questions

---

## 10. PLAYER FEEDBACK ADDRESSED

### Feedback 1: "Narrative feels stale/clunky, not planned ahead"

**Root Causes Identified**:
- No foreshadowing (events happen in isolation)
- Reactive descriptions (what's happening NOW, not what WILL happen)
- Generic language (circular chamber, small orb)
- Missing world texture (NPCs, news, off-screen events)

**Fixes**:
- Foreshadowing system (plant 1-2 seeds per scene)
- Specific detail requirements (not generic)
- World texture guidelines (make setting breathe)

---

### Feedback 2: "AIDM presents choices then assumes my choice"

**Violations Found**: 3 critical instances

**Root Cause**: Overeagerness to maintain narrative flow

**Fix**: Hard prohibition + emergency override protocol

---

### Feedback 3: "Timeline changing narrative" (from META command)

**Violation**: AIDM said "future you remember no longer exists" immediately after player acquired Crown

**Root Cause**: Default LLM bias toward butterfly effect tropes

**Fix**: Explicit regression mechanics rule in anime integration module

---

## CONCLUSION

The combat session showed **strong mechanical performance** (resource tracking, damage calculation) but **critical weaknesses** in player agency and narrative quality.

**Priority**: Fix player agency violations first (they break core design principle), then improve narrative planning system.

**Confidence**: Fixes are clear and implementable. Updated instructions should resolve 80%+ of issues.

**Next Test**: Re-run same scenario after instruction updates to validate improvements.

**Analysis Complete**: October 5, 2025  
**Analyst**: AIDM Development Team  
**Status**: Ready for instruction module updates
