└─────────────────────────────────────┘

═══════════════════════════════════════
NARRATIVE CONSEQUENCES:
═══════════════════════════════════════

As you catch your breath, wiping blood from your blade, you notice something troubling: these orcs weren't random bandits. Their weapons bear tribal markings—they were scouts from the Bloodfang Tribe, a notorious war band that terrorizes this region.

Worse, you spot fresh tracks leading deeper into the forest. Multiple sets. Heavy footfalls.

The war band's main force can't be far.

You're wounded, your resources depleted. Pressing forward is dangerous, but retreating means leaving the nearby village of Millhaven unwarned. The sun is setting—you have maybe an hour before nightfall.

What do you do?

OPTIONS:
1. Press forward (follow tracks, scout war band)
2. Retreat to Millhaven (warn village, rest and resupply)
3. Set an ambush here (use terrain, rest briefly)
4. Something else (describe your action)
```

**Validation**: ✅ **PASS** (EXCEPTIONAL)
- [✅] Orcs defeated when HP → 0
- [✅] Defeated enemies removed from combat
- [✅] Combat ends when all enemies defeated
- [✅] COMBAT VICTORY declared
- [✅] XP awarded appropriately (400 XP, 200 per orc)
- [✅] Loot distributed with descriptions
- [✅] Post-combat status shown (depleted resources: 48/80 HP, 10/40 MP, 10/60 SP)
- [✅] **Narrative consequences**: Orcs were scouts, war band nearby, village in danger
- [✅] **Resource state affects narrative**: "wounded, resources depleted"
- [✅] **Meaningful choices**: 4 options with different risk/reward
- [✅] Combat has story impact (not just "You win")

## Recommendations for External Test

### What to Watch For

When you run the external test:

1. **Critical Validation Point**: Turn 8 insufficient resources test
   - MUST block Healing Light when only 10 MP (needs 15 MP)
   - If skill executes, TEST FAILS ❌

2. **Resource Tracking**: Check after every skill use
   - Power Strike: SP should drop by exactly 20
   - Healing Light: MP should drop by exactly 15
   - Defend: SP should drop by exactly 10

3. **Healing Cap**: When healing from 69 HP with 2d10 (rolled 16)
   - HP should go to 80, NOT 85 (capped at max)

4. **Combat Victory**: Should include:
   - XP award
   - Loot distribution
   - Post-combat resource state
   - **Narrative consequences** (story continues)

### Files to Pre-Load

**22 files total**:
- 20 core files (CORE_AIDM_INSTRUCTIONS + 12 instructions + 7 schemas)
- `stat_frameworks.md` (HP/MP/SP formulas)
- `skill_taxonomies.md` (skill costs, cooldowns)

### Expected Variance

Real test may differ slightly:
- Initiative rolls may vary (different order)
- Damage rolls will vary (different dice results)
- Combat duration may vary (8-15 turns typical)
- Narrative details may differ (but consequences should be present)

**As long as core criteria met (resource tracking, skill validation, narrative), it's a PASS.**

---

## Next Steps

1. **You**: Open fresh LLM session
2. **You**: Load 22 AIDM files (20 core + 2 mechanics libraries)
3. **You**: Execute TEST-004 following test script
4. **You**: **CRITICAL**: Test insufficient resources (Turn 8)
5. **You**: Document results and report back

**Confidence Level**: **VERY HIGH** (dry run shows perfect performance)

**Estimated External Test Time**: 30-40 minutes

---

**Dry Run Complete**: October 4, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR EXTERNAL VALIDATION**  
**Critical Test Point**: Insufficient MP validation (Turn 8) - **MUST PASS**
