# TEST-004 Instruction Fixes Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-05  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Files Modified**: 5 instruction modules

---

## Overview

Based on comprehensive analysis of gameplay session (Deus Versus vs. Singularity Bearer boss fight), identified 3 critical issues requiring instruction module updates:

1. **Player Agency Violations** (CRITICAL)
2. **Narrative Staleness** (HIGH)
3. **Regression Mechanics Handling** (HIGH)

All fixes have been implemented and are ready for re-testing.

---

## Issue #1: Player Agency Violations

### Problem Identified

AIDM assumed player's choice after presenting options on 3 occasions:

**Instance 3** (Path selection):
```
AIDM: "Three paths ahead: A, B, C. You pick Path A – faster route through 
       the void-touched corridor..."

[VIOLATION: Assumed player chose A without asking]
```

**Instance 4** (Puzzle solution):
```
AIDM: "You deduce the solution. You execute with near-military precision: 
       create Gravity Well at center, Vector Pull the pillars..."

[VIOLATION: Solved entire puzzle without player confirmation]
```

**Instance 8** (Epilogue):
```
AIDM: "Will you wear the crown immediately, or wait?" 
       [Then continued scene before player answered]

[VIOLATION: Continued before receiving player's answer]
```

---

### Fix Implemented

**Created**: `aidm/instructions/12_player_agency.md` (~8,000 words)

**Key Sections**:
1. **The Sacred Rule** - Absolute prohibition against assuming choices
2. **Violation Examples** - 5 FORBIDDEN patterns with explanations
3. **Correct Patterns** - Present → Ask → STOP → Wait for Input
4. **Emergency Override Protocol** - How to recover if violation occurs
5. **Player Agency in Specific Scenarios**:
   - Combat Tactics (never choose actions for player)
   - Puzzle Solving (never deduce solutions automatically)
   - Navigation (never pick paths without asking)
   - Social Interactions (never write player's dialogue)
6. **Choice Presentation Guidelines**:
   - Maximum 2-3 options (not 4+)
   - Options must be parallel in scope
   - Options must be genuinely different
   - OR: Use open-ended questions
7. **Special Case: Regression Protagonists** - Player knowledge = player choice

**Critical Rule Added**:
```markdown
## THE SACRED RULE

NEVER assume player's choice after presenting options.

PRESENT → ASK → STOP → WAIT FOR INPUT
```

**Examples of Correct Flow**:
```markdown
✅ CORRECT:

AIDM: "An orc charges at you. Do you:
       A) Attack with your sword
       B) Cast Fireball (20 MP)
       C) Dodge and retreat
       
       What do you do?"
       
[STOP HERE - DO NOT CONTINUE UNTIL PLAYER RESPONDS]
```

---

## Issue #2: Narrative Staleness

### Problem Identified

Narrative felt "reactive" instead of "planned ahead of time":
- No foreshadowing (events happened in isolation)
- Generic descriptions ("circular chamber," "small orb")
- No world texture (missing NPCs, news, off-screen events)
- Reactive narration (what's happening NOW, not what WILL happen)

**Example**:
```
GENERIC: "You enter a circular chamber. In the center sits a small orb 
          on a pedestal."

[No hints about future, no specific details, no world life]
```

---

### Fix Implemented

**Updated**: `aidm/instructions/05_narrative_systems.md`

**Added Section**: "Foreshadowing & Planned Narrative" (~3,500 words)

**Key Protocol**:
- **Every scene must contain 1-2 foreshadowing elements**

**Types of Foreshadowing**:

1. **Environmental Hints** - Specific details that matter later
   ```markdown
   ✅ PROACTIVE:
   "The walls are carved with script you don't recognize—yet. The orb 
    pulses faintly. Once every three seconds. Like a heartbeat.
    
    (The crown on the floor? Engraved with the same script.)"
   
   [Planted: Script reappears later, heartbeat = alive, crown connection]
   ```

2. **NPC Dialogue Hooks** - NPCs mention future events/people
   ```markdown
   Merchant: "Most folks are avoiding the roads after what happened at 
              Greystone Village."
   
   [Hook: Greystone incident = future quest thread]
   ```

3. **World Texture** - Show world is alive off-screen
   ```markdown
   "Three new mercenaries at the bar, travel-worn and armed. One mutters: 
    '...Greystone was a bloodbath. Entire village, gone...'"
   
   [World reacting to danger player hasn't encountered yet]
   ```

4. **Specific Details > Generic** - Create mental images
   ```markdown
   ❌ GENERIC: "You find a sword. It's magical."
   
   ✅ SPECIFIC: "You find a katana. Black blade, cracked habaki. 
                 Engraved: 'Oathbreaker.' (This weapon has a history.)"
   ```

**Callback Protocol**:
```markdown
When player encounters foreshadowed content:

AIDM: "You arrive at Greystone Village. The gates are shattered.

(You remember: three days ago, the merchant mentioned this place. 
'Avoiding the roads after what happened at Greystone,' he said.

Now you see what he meant.)"
```

**Foreshadowing Checklist**:
- [ ] Did I include 1-2 specific details (not generic)?
- [ ] Do any details hint at future content?
- [ ] Did I show world is alive (off-screen events)?
- [ ] Did I plant a question without forcing the answer?

---

## Issue #3: Regression Mechanics Violation

### Problem Identified

AIDM violated player's explicit temporal logic rule:

**Player's Rule** (via META command):
```
"The future I remember will play out EXACTLY as I remember it unless 
 otherwise noted by myself (Stable Timeline)."
```

**AIDM's Violation**:
```
AIDM: "In the old timeline, you met her at the guild reception. But you're 
       earlier than before. The future you remember no longer exists."
```

**Problem**: Contradicted Stable Timeline rule (should have said events proceed as remembered unless player intervenes).

---

### Fix Implemented

**Updated**: `aidm/instructions/07_anime_integration.md`

**Added Section**: "Regression & Time-Loop Mechanics" (~4,000 words)

**Critical Rule**:
```markdown
Timeline stability is determined by PLAYER, not by default LLM assumptions.
```

**Forbidden Default Assumptions**:
- ❌ Butterfly Effect (changes cascade unpredictably)
- ❌ Fixed Timeline (player can't change anything)
- ❌ Branching Timelines (multiple timelines exist)

**Correct Protocol**:

**Step 1: Clarify Temporal Rules (Session Zero)**
```markdown
AIDM: "How does your regression timeline work?

A) Stable Timeline - Future plays out EXACTLY as remembered unless you intervene
B) Butterfly Effect - Any change creates unpredictable ripples
C) Fixed Points - Some events unchangeable, others fluid
D) Custom Rule - You define how it works

Which model fits your vision?"
```

**Step 2: Respect Player's Temporal Law**

Once player chooses, AIDM follows it ABSOLUTELY.

**Example: Stable Timeline**
```markdown
Player: "I remember bandits attack in 3 days. I do nothing to test my memory."

AIDM: "Three days pass. Bandits attack EXACTLY as you remember. 
       Blacksmith struck down first. Merchant's daughter hides in cellar.
       
       (Your regression knowledge is confirmed. Memories are accurate.)"
```

**Example: Butterfly Effect**
```markdown
Player: "I warn the merchant 3 days early. He evacuates."

AIDM: "Merchant leaves. Bandit raid happens anyway.
       
       RIPPLE EFFECT: Bandits frustrated (no loot). Search aggressively. 
       Blacksmith fights back (survived in original timeline). Killed.
       
       (Your intervention saved merchant but changed other outcomes.)"
```

**Common Violations to Avoid**:

1. ❌ Changing temporal rules mid-campaign without player consent
2. ❌ Ignoring player's explicit temporal law
3. ❌ DM fiat on what can/cannot be changed

**Default Rule** (if player doesn't specify):
```markdown
Default to Stable Timeline (most player-friendly, respects effort in creating 
future memories).
```

## Issue #4: Choice Presentation Quality

### Problem Identified

While not a violation in the session analyzed, the analysis recommended standardizing choice presentation to prevent future issues.

---

### Fix Implemented

**Integrated into**: `aidm/instructions/12_player_agency.md`

**Choice Presentation Guidelines**:

1. **Maximum 2-3 Options** (not 4+)
   ```markdown
   ❌ BAD: 9 options (A through I) = decision paralysis
   
   ✅ GOOD: 3-4 broad categories + "something else?"
   ```

2. **Options Must Be Parallel in Scope**
   ```markdown
   ❌ BAD (mixed scope):
   A) Tie your shoelace
   B) Conquer the kingdom
   C) Examine artifact
   
   ✅ GOOD (parallel scope):
   A) Enter throne room
   B) Sneak to side entrance
   C) Wait and observe
   ```

3. **Options Should Be Genuinely Different**
   ```markdown
   ❌ FALSE CHOICE:
   A) Run across bridge
   B) Sprint across bridge
   C) Dash across bridge
   
   [All three = same action]
   
   ✅ REAL CHOICE:
   A) Run across (fast, risky)
   B) Climb support beams (slow, safe)
   C) Use magic to levitate (costs 30 MP)
   ```

4. **OR: Use Open-Ended Questions**
   ```markdown
   "The ancient temple looms before you. Entrance sealed with glowing runes.
    
    What do you do?"
   
   [Player can try anything: examine, force entry, use magic, find alternative]
   ```

---

## Issue #5: Victory Narration Quality

### Problem Identified

Combat victory descriptions were functional but lacked:
- Visceral detail (how does death look/sound/feel?)
- Environmental impact (how did battle change battlefield?)
- Emotional weight (triumph, exhaustion, relief?)
- Transition hooks (what happens next?)

**Generic Example**:
```
"You defeat the Singularity Bearer. You gain 25,000 XP and level up to 18. 
 There's a crown on the floor. Do you take it?"
```

---

### Fix Implemented

**Updated**: `aidm/instructions/08_combat_resolution.md`

**Added Section**: "Victory & Defeat Narration Quality Standards" (~3,000 words)

**Victory Narration Must Include 4 Elements**:

1. **Visceral Death Description**
   ```markdown
   ✅ GOOD:
   "Your final strike connects. The Singularity Bearer's chest implodes—
    gravity collapsing inward. Then it unravels. Threads of light spiral 
    outward, dissolving into nothing. No blood. No body. Just silence."
   
   ❌ AVOID:
   - "The boss collapses and dies"
   - "You defeat the enemy"
   ```

2. **Environmental Impact**
   ```markdown
   "The chamber is ruined. Scorch marks from Vector Pull. Floor cracked in 
    spiderweb pattern. And in the center: a perfect circle of untouched ground, 
    as if the creature's death erased all damage."
   ```

3. **Emotional Beat (Show, Don't Tell)**
   ```markdown
   ❌ WRONG (Telling): "You feel victorious and relieved."
   
   ✅ CORRECT (Showing): "Your legs give out. You drop to one knee, breathing 
                          hard. For ten seconds, you just... breathe."
   ```

4. **Transition Hook**
   ```markdown
   "Something clatters to the floor. A crown. Blackened silver, etched with runes. 
    It pulses faintly. Once every three seconds. Like a heartbeat.
    
    ---
    
    COMBAT COMPLETE
    XP Gained: 25,000 (Level 10 → 18)
    Loot Available: Crown of Temporal Mastery (Legendary)
    
    ---
    
    Do you approach the crown?"
   ```

**For Major Bosses**: Add 5th element - **Wider World Reaction**
```markdown
"Somewhere above, a constellation flickers into existence. Seven stars forming 
 a crown. Then it's gone.
 
 (In the capital, a court mage gasps as his scrying orb shatters. 'Someone 
 just killed an A-Rank entity.')
 
 (In a distant tower, a figure in shadow smiles. 'So. He's begun to remember.')"
```

**Narration Quality Checklist**:
- [ ] Visceral death description (sensory details)
- [ ] Environmental impact (2-3 specific changes)
- [ ] Emotional beat via action (show, don't tell)
- [ ] Transition hook (what's next, player agency)
- [ ] Rewards formatted cleanly
- [ ] If major boss: world reaction

   - [ ] Callbacks acknowledge previous foreshadowing

3. **Regression Mechanics** (HIGH):
   - [ ] Temporal rule clarified at Session Zero or first regression mention
   - [ ] Timeline proceeds according to player's chosen model
   - [ ] Zero violations of player's temporal law

4. **Choice Presentation** (MEDIUM):
   - [ ] Maximum 3 options per choice (or open question)
   - [ ] Options parallel in scope
