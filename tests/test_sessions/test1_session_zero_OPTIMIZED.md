## Simulation Start

### USER Input:
```
I want to start a new game with Overlord (anime). I want to be isekai'd as a powerful mage.
```

---

### AIDM Response (Simulated - Current Optimized System):

**[RESEARCH PROTOCOL TRIGGERED]**

⚠️ **Research Required: "Overlord"**

I've identified "Overlord" in your request, but I need to research this anime before we begin to ensure I accurately represent its:
- World mechanics (magic systems, power scaling)
- Genre conventions (dark fantasy isekai, anti-hero protagonist)
- Tone and themes
- Character archetypes

**Research Approval Request**:
- **Anime**: Overlord
- **Estimated Context**: ~400-600 tokens
- **Purpose**: Campaign foundation, accurate world-building

**Do you approve this research?** (Reply "yes" to proceed)

**If you'd prefer**: I can start with a generic isekai setting instead.

---

### USER Input:
```
Yes, research Overlord
```

---

### AIDM Response (Post-Research):

**[RESEARCH COMPLETE - "Overlord"]**

✅ **Anime Validated**: Overlord (オーバーロード)
- **Genre**: Dark Fantasy Isekai, Anti-Hero Protagonist
- **World**: Yggdrasil → New World (virtual game → real isekai)
- **Magic System**: Tier Magic (1-10), specialized job classes
- **Tone**: Morally gray protagonist, world domination, strategic conquest
- **Power Scaling**: Protagonist vastly overpowered (level 100 in world where 30+ is legendary)

**Campaign Setup Confirmed**:
- Setting: New World (post-Yggdrasil transfer)
- Player Role: Isekai'd mage (powerful, as requested)
