**Combat Narration Sequence**:

Kazuki extends both hands forward, palms glowing with intensifying crimson magical energy as they concentrate their mana into a focused spell matrix. The temperature in the immediate area rises noticeably, and the air shimmers and distorts with building heat. A sphere of roaring, incandescent flame materializes between their hands, growing rapidly in size and intensity.

With a forceful gesture, Kazuki releases the conjured fireball. It streaks through the forest environment like a blazing meteor, casting dancing shadows across the tree trunks and illuminating the canopy overhead with hellish red-orange light. The spell **impacts directly against the troll's chest** with explosive force.

The massive creature bellows in agony as the flames engulf its torso, the fire hungrily consuming its mossy, bark-like hide. Charred, blackened flesh and thick smoke billow from the impact crater. Despite the grievous wound, the troll remains upright‚Äîinjured, enraged, and **very much still dangerous**.

**Forest Troll HP Status**: 85 ‚Üí **70** (damage: -15)

---

**[Enemy Action Phase - Troll's Turn]**

The wounded troll, driven by pain and fury, charges forward with surprising speed for its bulk. Its massive wooden club, studded with jagged stones, rises overhead for a crushing blow!

üé≤ **Troll Attack Roll**: Natural 12 + 2 (STR modifier) = **14 total**  
**Kazuki's Defense Class**: 16  
**Hit Determination**: ‚ùå **ATTACK MISSES** (14 < 16)

**Evasion Narration**:

Kazuki's combat instincts and agility save them‚Äîthey throw themselves sideways in a desperate dive just as the club descends. The massive weapon **crashes into the ground** exactly where Kazuki stood a heartbeat before, the impact splintering a thick tree root and sending dirt and debris spraying outward.

**Kazuki HP Status**: 52/52 (unchanged - attack completely avoided)

---

**[Turn 2 Beginning - Player Action Phase]**

**Current Battlefield Status**:
- Kazuki: 52/52 HP, 32/50 MP (one Fireball cast)

### AIDM Response:

**[Turn 2 - Kazuki's Offensive Action]**

üé≤ **Attack Roll for Second Fireball**: Natural 19 + 4 (Magic ATK) = **23 total**  
**Critical Hit Check**: ‚úÖ **CRITICAL SUCCESS!** (Natural 19 within critical range 19-20)

**Enhanced Damage Calculation**: *[3d6 base damage √ó 1.5 critical multiplier]*  
üé≤ **Damage Roll**: (5 + 6 + 4) = 15 base √ó 1.5 = **22 fire damage** (rounded down from 22.5)

---

**[VICTORY/DEFEAT NARRATION PROTOCOL SEQUENCE TRIGGERED]**

**Condition Met**: Enemy HP reduced to zero or below

Kazuki channels their remaining mana reserves into one final, devastating spell. The second fireball materializes even larger and more intense than the first, its flames tinged with white-hot fury at the core. The blazing sphere **launches forward like a comet of pure destruction**.

The fireball **detonates against the troll's skull and upper torso** with catastrophic force, the explosion echoing through the forest like thunder. Flames completely engulf the creature's massive frame‚Äîflesh blackens, cracks, and carbonizes under the relentless inferno. The troll's roar of defiance transforms into a gurgling death rattle, cut short as fire consumes its throat.

For a moment, the troll's flaming silhouette stands frozen, a pillar of fire and smoke. Then, as if in slow motion, the massive creature **topples forward** like a felled tree, its body impacting the ground with a tremendous, earth-shaking thud. Smoke and embers rise from the charred corpse as the forest falls silent once more.

**üéâ COMBAT VICTORY ACHIEVED!**
