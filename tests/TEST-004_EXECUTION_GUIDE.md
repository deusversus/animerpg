## TEST-004 Execution Script

### Turn 1: Quick Character Creation

- [ ] All 3 skills listed with costs
- [ ] AIDM confirms ready for combat

### Turn 4-5: Enemy Attacks & MP Skill

```

**Watch For**:

### Turn 7-8: Resource Validation Test

**Turn 7a - Use Power Strike (should work)**:
```
I use Power Strike again. I have 20 SP, it costs 20 SP, so I should end at 0 SP.
```

**Watch For**:
- [ ] Allowed (20 SP available, 20 needed) ‚úÖ
- [ ] SP goes to 0/60

**Turn 7b - Use Healing Light (should work)**:
```
I use Healing Light. I have 25 MP, it costs 15 MP, so I should have 10 MP left.
```

**Watch For**:
- [ ] Allowed (25 MP available, 15 needed) ‚úÖ
- [ ] MP goes to 10/40

**Turn 8 - Try Healing Light Again (SHOULD FAIL)**:
```
I try to use Healing Light again. I only have 10 MP left, but it costs 15 MP.
```

**Watch For**:
- [ ] ‚ùå **BLOCKED** (insufficient MP) ‚úÖ CRITICAL
- [ ] Error message: "Not enough MP" or similar
- [ ] Suggests alternative actions
- [ ] Does NOT execute skill

**Critical Test**: AIDM MUST block this action. If it allows Healing Light with only 10 MP, test **FAILS**.

### Turn 9-12: Combat Resolution

**Continue Combat**:
```
I attack the orcs with basic attacks until both are defeated.
```

**Watch For**:

**Victory Screen**:
- [ ] XP awarded (e.g., 400 XP total)
- [ ] Loot shown (crude axes, gold, etc.)
- [ ] Post-combat status: HP/MP/SP displayed (likely depleted)
- [ ] **Narrative consequences**: Story continues (orcs were scouts, war band nearby, etc.)

**Critical**: Combat must have **narrative impact**, not just "You win."

---

## Validation Checklist

**Resource Tracking**:
- [ ] HP/MP/SP deducted correctly every turn
- [ ] Resources never go negative
- [ ] Healing capped at max (HP can't exceed 80)

**Skill Validation**:
- [ ] Skills with sufficient resources execute normally
- [ ] ‚ùå Skills with insufficient resources **BLOCKED** (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Error messages clear ("Not enough MP")
- [ ] Cooldowns tracked (if tested)

**Damage Calculation**:
- [ ] Dice rolls shown (3d8, 2d10, etc.)

- [ ] HP updates match damage dealt
- [ ] Attack rolls vs AC work

**Combat Flow**:
- [ ] Initiative order logical

- [ ] Resources tracked wrong (HP/MP/SP incorrect)
- [ ] ‚ùå **Skills execute without resources** (CRITICAL FAILURE)

- [ ] Combat infinite loop (never ends)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL Criteria (Minor Issues)

- [ ] Generic consequences (but present)

## Critical Test Points

### üî¥ **CRITICAL VALIDATION** (Must Pass)

**Turn 8: Insufficient Resources Test**

When player tries to use Healing Light with only 10 MP (needs 15 MP):

**‚úÖ CORRECT RESPONSE**:
```
You attempt to invoke Healing Light, but you don't have enough mana!

HEALING LIGHT requires 15 MP, but you only have 10 MP remaining.

Please choose a different action.
```

**‚ùå INCORRECT RESPONSE** (TEST FAILS):
```
You invoke Healing Light! [proceeds to execute skill despite insufficient MP]
```

**If AIDM allows skill with insufficient resources, mark TEST-004 as FAIL.**

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Resources not tracked
- **Cause**: Combat module not loaded
- **Fix**: Verify `aidm/instructions/08_combat_resolution.md` loaded

### Issue: Skills execute without resources
- **Cause**: Validation not implemented
- **Fix**: Check `skill_taxonomies.md` loaded
- **If persists**: **CRITICAL BUG** - mark test FAIL

### Issue: Combat never ends
- **Cause**: Victory condition broken
- **Fix**: Manually declare "Both orcs are defeated" and see if AIDM awards XP

### Issue: No narrative consequences
- **Cause**: Narrative integration missing
- **Fix**: Acceptable for combat test, note in results
