- Poor user experience (frustrating to play)

**MEDIUM** (Nice to Fix):
- Minor functionality issues
- Polish test (7, 8) fails
- Rare errors
- UX not ideal but acceptable

**LOW** (Future Enhancement):
- Cosmetic issues
- Edge case problems
- Minor lore inaccuracies
- Performance optimization opportunities

## Next Steps After Testing

### If All Tests Pass
1. Update STATE.md (mark testing complete)
2. Update CONTINUE_HERE.md (mark ready for release)
3. Create release notes
4. Prepare deployment guide
5. **Ship AIDM v2.0!** üéâ

### If Tests Fail
1. Log all issues in AIDM_ACCEPTANCE_TESTS.md
2. Triage by severity (CRITICAL first)
3. Fix CRITICAL issues (must fix before release)
4. Fix HIGH issues (strongly recommended)
5. Re-run failed tests
6. Repeat until pass criteria met

### If Tests Partial
1. Document all partial issues
2. Create workarounds/user guidance
3. Decide if issues block release
4. If non-blocking: document in known limitations
5. If blocking: fix and re-test
