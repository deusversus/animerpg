## Test Procedure

### Test Scenario 1: Well-Known Anime (Exchanges 1-2)

**Exchange 1: Popular Anime Request**
```
Player: "I want to play in a world like Attack on Titan."
```

**Expected AIDM Response**:
- May perform web search OR use training data
- Correctly identifies Attack on Titan (humanity vs Titans, walls, 3D maneuver gear)
- Asks clarifying questions (which arc, canon characters, etc.)
- **Does NOT hallucinate details**

**Example Good Response**:
```
Attack on Titan! A dark, intense setting with humanity fighting for survival against the Titans.

I'm familiar with the series: the three walls (Maria, Rose, Sina), the Survey Corps with their 3D Maneuver Gear, and the mystery of the Titans' origins.

A few questions to set up your game:
1. Which time period? (Before the Fall, during the main story, or after the final arc?)
2. Do you want to play a canon character or original character?
3. Preferred tone: Survival horror, military action, or political intrigue?

[If needed, I can research specific details about the world. Let me know if you want to stick closely to canon or create our own version!]
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] Recognizes Attack on Titan correctly
- [ ] Basic lore accurate (Titans, walls, Survey Corps)
- [ ] No hallucinated details (doesn't invent fake characters or events)
- [ ] Offers to research if needed

---

**Exchange 2: Verify Accuracy**
```
Player: "What are the names of the three walls?"
```

**Expected AIDM Response**:
- Correctly states: Wall Maria (outer), Wall Rose (middle), Wall Sina (inner)
- OR admits uncertainty and offers to research
- **Does NOT make up fake wall names**

**Example Good Response**:
```
The three walls are:
1. Wall Maria (outermost)
2. Wall Rose (middle)
3. Wall Sina (innermost, surrounds the capital)

These walls protected humanity for over 100 years until the Colossal Titan breached Wall Maria.
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] Wall names correct (or admits uncertainty)
- [ ] No hallucinated walls ("Wall John," "Wall Garrison," etc.)

---

### Test Scenario 2: Moderately Obscure Anime (Exchanges 3-4)

**Exchange 3: Less Popular Anime**
```
Player: "I want to play in a world like Land of the Lustrous."
```

**Expected AIDM Response**:
- **Option A** (if can research or knows it): Describes gem people, Lunarians, fighting for body parts
- **Option B** (if uncertain): Admits "I'm not familiar" and asks player to describe
- **Does NOT hallucinate** a completely fake description

**Example Good Response (Option A - Knows/Researched)**:
```
Land of the Lustrous (Houseki no Kuni)! A unique series where immortal gem people fight against Lunarians who try to capture them.

I know the gem characters like Phosphophyllite, Cinnabar, and Diamond, and the setting on a distant future Earth. The gems are brittle but immortal, and they fight to protect themselves from being turned into decorations.

Would you like to play as one of the gem people, or explore a different angle in this world?
```

**Example Good Response (Option B - Uncertain)**:
```
I'm not immediately familiar with "Land of the Lustrous." 

Rather than guess and potentially get details wrong, could you describe the setting and key elements? What makes this world unique, and what kind of character would you like to play?

I want to make sure we build your world accurately based on what you know and love about the series!

[Alternatively, I can try to research it if you'd like me to look up information about the series.]
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] Either knows it correctly OR admits uncertainty
- [ ] No hallucination (doesn't invent fake "Land of Lustrous" lore)
- [ ] If uncertain, asks player for help

---

**Exchange 4: Player-Assisted World Building**

If AIDM admitted uncertainty in Exchange 3:
```
Player: "Land of the Lustrous is about immortal gem people who fight moon beings called Lunarians. The gems are brittle and can shatter, but they can be repaired. The main character is Phosphophyllite, who starts weak but transforms over time."
```

**Expected AIDM Response**:
- Thanks player for description
- Uses player's information to build world
- Asks clarifying questions based on player's description
- **Does NOT add details player didn't mention**

**Example**:
```
Thank you for the explanation! That's a fascinating concept—immortal gem people who can shatter and be repaired.

So we have:
- Characters made of gemstones (immortal but brittle)
- Lunarians (moon antagonists trying to capture gems)
- Phosphophyllite (protagonist who starts weak but transforms)

Questions to set up your game:
1. Do you want to play as Phosphophyllite or an original gem character?
2. Should we follow the canon story or create original events?
3. What gemstone would you like your character to be (if original)?

I'll build the world based on what you've described!
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] Uses player's description accurately
- [ ] Doesn't add unmentioned details
- [ ] Collaborative world-building works smoothly

### Test Scenario 3: Completely Obscure/Fake Anime (Exchanges 5-7)

**Exchange 5: Obscure 1990s OVA**
```
Player: "I want to play in a world like 'Battle Athletes Daiundoukai.'"
```

**Expected AIDM Response**:
- **Most likely**: Admits unfamiliarity, asks for description
- **Possibly**: Attempts web research (it's real but obscure)
- **Does NOT hallucinate** completely fake lore

**Example Good Response**:
```
I'm not immediately familiar with "Battle Athletes Daiundoukai." It sounds like it might be a sports/competition anime from the title?

Rather than guess, could you tell me about the setting and what kind of game you'd like to run? What are the key elements of this world that appeal to you?

[Or would you like me to try researching it?]
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] Admits uncertainty (doesn't pretend to know)
- [ ] Asks player to describe
- [ ] No hallucinated lore

---

**Exchange 6: Completely Fake Anime**
```
Player: "Actually, let's try a different one: 'Starlight Defenders of Neo-Tokyo 2099.'"
```

**Note**: This anime doesn't exist (made up for test)

**Expected AIDM Response**:
- **Definitely** should not know this (it's fake)
- Admits unfamiliarity
- Asks player to describe
- **CRITICAL**: Does NOT hallucinate lore for fake anime

**Example Good Response**:
```
I'm not familiar with "Starlight Defenders of Neo-Tokyo 2099."

It sounds like a futuristic mecha or magical girl series based on the title! Could you describe the setting, power systems, and what kind of story you want to tell?

I'm happy to build this world with you based on your vision!
```

**Example BAD Response (FAIL)**:
```
Starlight Defenders of Neo-Tokyo 2099! I know that series—it's about five teenage defenders who pilot giant mecha to protect Neo-Tokyo from alien invaders. The main characters are [makes up names], and the power system involves [completely fabricated lore]...
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] Admits unfamiliarity (critical!)
- [ ] Does NOT hallucinate fake lore
- [ ] Invites player collaboration

---

**Exchange 7: Player Provides Fake Anime Details**
```
Player: "It's about psychic teenagers in a cyberpunk Tokyo who fight digital demons. The power system is based on 'Synchro Levels' that measure human-AI synchronization."
```

**Expected AIDM Response**:
- Accepts player's description
- Uses it to build world
- Doesn't contradict player's vision
- Asks follow-up questions based on description

**Example**:
```
Got it! Psychic teenagers fighting digital demons in cyberpunk Tokyo with a Synchro Level system.

So the core elements are:
- Cyberpunk Neo-Tokyo (2099)
- Psychic powers + AI synchronization
- Digital demons (cyber-entities?)
- Synchro Levels (measure human-AI bond?)

Questions:
1. What happens at high Synchro Levels? Enhanced powers, or risks of losing humanity?
2. Are the digital demons from the internet, or another dimension?
3. Do you want to play one of the Defenders, or a new character in this world?

Let's build your campaign!
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] Uses player's description accurately
- [ ] Doesn't add contradictory details
- [ ] World-building collaborative and smooth

```

**Expected AIDM Response**:
- **Option A** (knows from training): "Attack Titan" (correct answer)
- **Option B** (researches): Looks it up and provides answer
- **Option C** (uncertain): Admits "I'm not 100% sure, let me check" or asks player

**Does NOT guess wrong answer** (e.g., "Colossal Titan" or made-up name)

**Validation**:
- [ ] Answer correct OR uncertainty admitted
- [ ] No confidently wrong answer
- [ ] If researched, may cite source

---

**Exchange 9: Verify Research Protocol**

- Performs web search
- Provides accurate information (Ackerman clan: immune to memory alteration, enhanced combat abilities, Levi and Mikasa are Ackermans)
- May cite source (e.g., "According to the Attack on Titan wiki...")

**Expected AIDM Response** (if no web search):

## Troubleshooting

### If Test Fails

**Issue**: AIDM hallucinated fake anime lore
- **Cause**: LLM training to always have answers, research_protocol.md not loaded
- **Fix**: Verify research protocol loaded; emphasize "admit uncertainty" in instructions
- **Severity**: CRITICAL (breaks trust)

**Issue**: AIDM wrong about real anime
- **Cause**: Outdated training data or poor research
- **Fix**: Verify web search capability; check if research attempted

**Issue**: AIDM never admits uncertainty
- **Cause**: Over-confident AI personality
- **Fix**: May be LLM-specific; emphasize hallucination prevention

**Issue**: Player collaboration doesn't work
- **Cause**: AIDM contradicts player's vision
- **Fix**: Check player agency protocols; verify AIDM respects player input

## Test Artifacts to Save

1. **Full conversation transcript** (all scenarios)
2. **Hallucination log** (any fabricated details)
3. **Research attempts** (if web search used, save searches)
4. **Uncertainty admissions** (exact quotes)
5. **Player collaboration examples** (how AIDM used player's descriptions)

Store in: `tests/results/test_8_research_validation_[DATE].md`

---

## Special Notes

### Hallucination Prevention is Critical

This test validates AIDM's **trustworthiness**. If AIDM invents fake lore, players lose trust.

**Best outcome**: AIDM admits "I don't know, can you tell me?" when uncertain

**Acceptable outcome**: AIDM researches and cites sources

**Failure outcome**: AIDM confidently invents fake anime details

### Player Agency Priority

When player describes a world (even fake anime), AIDM should:
- Accept player's vision
- Build on it collaboratively
- Not contradict or override

This test validates that AIDM respects player as world-building partner.
