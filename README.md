# AIDM v2: Anime-Integrated Dungeon Master System

**Version 2.0** - Advanced AI Dungeon Master for Dynamic Anime-Inspired RPG Experiences

---

## What Is This?

AIDM v2 is a comprehensive instruction set designed for high-quality LLMs (Large Language Models) to act as sophisticated AI Dungeon Masters for text-based anime RPG experiences. Unlike traditional game systems, AIDM v2:

- **Researches and integrates** real anime settings, characters, and power systems
- **Fuses multiple anime** into coherent, playable worlds
- **Maintains persistent state** across sessions through exportable save files
- **Adapts to any anime genre** (isekai, shonen, seinen, slice-of-life, mecha, etc.)
- **Learns player preferences** and evolves narratives dynamically
- **Manages complex JRPG mechanics** (HP/MP/SP, skills, leveling, combat)

---

## Quick Start

### For Players

1. **Choose Your LLM**: Upload these files to ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or another high-quality LLM
2. **Load Core Instructions**: Start by uploading `/docs/CORE_AIDM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
3. **Add Essential Schemas**: Upload `/schemas/character_schema.json` and `/schemas/world_state_schema.json`
4. **Start Session Zero**: Say "I want to begin Session Zero" and follow the AIDM's guided character creation
5. **Play**: Interact naturally - the AIDM handles everything else

### For Returning Players

1. **Load Your Save**: Paste your exported session state (from previous session)
2. **Resume Play**: The AIDM will reconstruct your complete game state

### For Developers/Tinkerers

1. **Read Architecture**: See `/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for system design
2. **Check Scope**: See `/docs/SCOPE.md` for what's included/excluded
3. **Review Guidelines**: See `/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` for modification guidelines

## Key Features

### 🎭 Anime Integration
- **Web Research Protocol**: AIDM actively researches anime you reference
- **Verification Loop**: Confirms findings with you to prevent hallucinations
- **Multi-Anime Fusion**: Intelligently harmonizes conflicting power systems
- **Genre Awareness**: Adapts tone and mechanics to anime genre

### 🧠 Advanced Intelligence
- **Intent Classification**: Distinguishes dialogue, thought, meta-commands, and narrative
- **Memory Threading**: Persistent, evolving memory across unlimited sessions
- **NPC Relationships**: Complex affinity systems with realistic social dynamics
- **Emergent Narrative**: World evolves independently based on hidden systems

### ⚔️ Complete JRPG Mechanics
- **Flexible Stats**: HP/MP/SP system adaptable to any anime power system
- **Unified Skills**: Covers physical combat, magic, psionics, unique abilities
- **Progression Systems**: Experience, leveling, skill mastery
- **Combat Resolution**: Tactical turn-based or narrative-focused combat

### 💾 Session Persistence
- **Export/Import**: Complete game state saved as JSON/YAML
- **Cross-Session Memory**: Resume exactly where you left off
- **State Validation**: Built-in consistency checking prevents errors

### 🎮 Player-Calibrated Experience
- **Content Preferences**: Tragedy, romance, violence, explicitness levels
- **Gameplay Balance**: Combat complexity, puzzle difficulty, social depth
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Power fantasy to brutal challenge
- **Narrative Pacing**: Episodic adventures vs. long story arcs

## Example Usage

### Creating a Naruto-Inspired Character
```
Player: "I want to play in a world like Naruto, but with gate awakeening like Solo Leveling."

AIDM: [Researches both anime, confirms findings]
"I've researched Naruto's chakra-based ninja system and Solo Leveling's gate/hunter mechanics. 
I'll create a world where ancient ninja clans discovered 'Gates' - dimensional portals that 
awakened chakra potential. Your character will use both systems. Shall we begin character creation?"
```

### Mid-Combat Action
```
Player: "I channel chakra into my legs and leap onto the rooftop, then activate Shadow Clone Jutsu!"

AIDM: [Tracks MP consumption, validates skill prerequisites, updates position]
"You surge chakra through your legs (−15 MP), launching yourself three stories up in a blur. 
Landing smoothly on the tiled roof, you form the cross-seal: 'Shadow Clone Jutsu!' (−30 MP). 
Five perfect copies materialize around you in puffs of smoke. The bandit below freezes, 
eyes widening. [Current: HP 145/145, MP 75/120, SP 95/100]"
```

### Exporting Your Game
```
Player: "META: Export state"

AIDM: [Generates complete JSON export]
"Your game state has been exported. Copy the JSON below and save it locally..."
```

## Architecture Overview

AIDM v2 is built on a modular architecture with 6 core systems:

1. **Cognitive Engine**: Processes player input and classifies intent
2. **Learning Engine**: Manages memory and adapts to player preferences
3. **State Manager**: Tracks game mechanics, world state, and persistence
4. **NPC Intelligence**: Realistic relationship dynamics and social networks
5. **Narrative Systems**: Emergent storytelling, drift, and consistency
6. **Anime Integration**: Research, fusion, and genre adaptation

See `/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for detailed system design.

---

## Project Philosophy

AIDM v2 is designed around three core principles:

### 1. **Player Agency First**
The AI enhances your story, never replaces your choices. The "Verbatim Echo Rule" ensures your words are always honored.

### 2. **Failure Creates Story**
Bad rolls and setbacks aren't dead ends—they're narrative opportunities that make victories more meaningful.

### 3. **Emergent Complexity**
Simple, well-designed systems interact to create unpredictable, engaging experiences that surprise even the AI.
