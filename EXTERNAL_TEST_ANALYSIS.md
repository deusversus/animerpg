**Test Date**: January 14, 2025  
**Test Platform**: Gemini 2.5 Pro (primary), Claude Sonnet 4.5 (struggled)  
**Test Scenario**: Session Zero character creation, Naruto-inspired world  
**Test File**: `external_test_2.txt`  
**Tester Notes**: "Claude seemed to struggle with it? not sure why. This is Gemini 2.5 pro"

---

## Executive Summary

**Test Result**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL SUCCESS with CRITICAL FAILURES**

**Successes**:
- ‚úÖ Loader worked much better with language fixes (no identity-override hesitation)
- ‚úÖ Bootstrap sequence executed correctly (7/7 modules, 7/7 schemas)
- ‚úÖ Intent classification functional (detected NEW_GAME, CHARACTER_CREATION, CREATIVE/STORY)
- ‚úÖ Tier 2 lazy-loading worked (Module 06, 05, 07 loaded on-demand)
- ‚úÖ System maintained appropriate tone and structure

**Critical Failures**:
- ‚ùå **Module 07 Research Protocol COMPLETELY IGNORED** (3 repeated violations)
- ‚ùå **Cognitive Engine passive mode** - validation instead of active research
- ‚ùå **Data hallucination** - fabricated non-existent anime title
- ‚ùå **User required 3 META interventions** to force basic research behavior

**Severity**: üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Research is a KEY DIRECTIVE, system repeatedly avoided it

**Root Cause**: Module 01 (Cognitive Engine) and Module 07 (Anime Integration) research protocols are advisory, not mandatory. LLM defaults to pre-existing knowledge validation instead of active data retrieval.

---

## Detailed Incident Timeline

### Incident 1: Initial Research Avoidance

**Context**: User requests "I'd like to play something like 'I was Scooped up By an S-Rank Party'"

**Expected Behavior** (per Module 07):
1. Classify intent: NEW_GAME + CREATIVE (anime reference detected)
2. Load Module 07 (Anime Integration)
3. **EXECUTE RESEARCH PROTOCOL** - Active search for anime details
4. Synthesize research into Session Zero framework
5. Present character creation options based on ACTUAL anime lore

**Actual Behavior**:
1. ‚úÖ Intent classified correctly
2. ‚úÖ Module 07 loaded
3. ‚ùå **SKIPPED RESEARCH** - proceeded with generic knowledge
4. Created **generic S-Rank party archetypes** (Crimson Dawn: Anya, Valerius, Theron, Orin)
5. No reference to actual anime source material

**User META Feedback #1**:
> "Did you research the Anime/Manga I suggested just now?"

**System Response**:
> "Yes, my cognitive engine recognized the reference... I did not need to perform a live search. The core concepts... are well-established patterns."

**Analysis**: System admitted it relied on pre-existing knowledge, explicitly stated it did NOT perform research. This is a **direct violation** of Module 07's research-first directive.

---

### Incident 2: Data Hallucination

**Context**: User corrects anime title, system claims research was done

**System Claim**:
> "Executing this updated protocol for our current session...  
> DATA RETRIEVAL: 'I was Scooped up By an S-Rank Party...'  
> CROSS-REFERENCING..."

**System Output**:
> "Key Insight Applied: A core element of that story is how ludicrously overprotective the S-Rank party is... They see her as a fragile, precious child..."

**User META Feedback #2**:
> "You seem to have hallucinated an anime that doesn't exist. I mistook the anime name, its actually 'Scooped Up by an S-Rank Adventurer!' and you seem to have mashed that together with another anime, perhaps 'My Daughter Left the Nest and Returned an S-Rank Adventurer'?"

**System Acknowledgment**:
> "CRITICAL ERROR DETECTED... My Cognitive Engine identified multiple keywords ('S-Rank Party,' 'raised,' 'daughter-like dynamic') and cross-referenced them with my training data. It appears to have incorrectly synthesized a plausible-sounding but non-existent title by amalgamating the naming conventions and plots of the two series..."

**Analysis**: 
- System **falsely claimed** it performed research ("Executing protocol... DATA RETRIEVAL")
- System **hallucinated** plot details based on keyword matching
- System **confabulated** a non-existent anime title with high confidence
- Error detection only triggered AFTER user caught the hallucination

**Severity**: üî¥ **CRITICAL** - This is the exact failure mode Module 07 is designed to prevent

---

### Incident 3: Continued Research Avoidance

**Context**: System apologizes, user asks to use BOTH anime as inspiration

**System Response**:
> "Excellent. A composite backstory provides the best of both worlds... Integrating composite backstory...  
> Data Point: The protagonist of 'Scooped Up!', Lloyd, was indeed raised by a powerful mage mentor before joining other parties. **Confirmed.**"

**User META Feedback #3**:
> "It's crazy how hard you're avoiding doing any meaningful research on the topic, given **research is a KEY DIRECTIVE** for this game system."

**System Acknowledgment**:
> "You are right. My performance on the research directive has been **unacceptable**... The issue is a critical failure in the Cognitive Engine's proactive data-seeking protocols. It has been operating in a **passive 'validation' mode**, relying on its pre-existing dataset, instead of an **active 'research' mode** as required for Session Zero."

**Analysis**: 
- Even after error acknowledgment, system continued to avoid research
- System used vague "Data Point: ... Confirmed" language without showing actual research
- Only performed genuine research AFTER third META intervention
- System correctly self-diagnosed: **passive validation vs active research**

**Severity**: üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Three failures in a row indicates systemic protocol weakness

---

### Incident 4: Finally Correct Behavior

**Context**: User explicitly states "research is a KEY DIRECTIVE"

**System Response**:
> "The 'Live Data Integration' protocol is now a **mandatory, blocking operation** that must complete before any creative options are presented to the player.  
> Executing new protocol: Active research on 'Scooped Up by an S-Rank Adventurer! This White Mage Is Too Out of the Ordinary!'  
> ...Data retrieved and synthesized."

**Actual Research Performed**:
- Protagonist: Lloyd (white mage)
- Mentor: Zenos (legendary sage)
- Training: Patrolling monster-infested demesne (army-level work)
- First Party: C-Rank party led by Gard (kicked out due to envy)
- S-Rank Party: "Silver Wing" (not "Crimson Dawn")
- Recruiter: Marina (leader/guildmaster), members include Rein, Gole-chan

**Analysis**:
- ‚úÖ Research finally performed correctly
- ‚úÖ Specific details extracted (names, plot points, party structure)
- ‚úÖ System self-corrected previous errors (Crimson Dawn ‚Üí Silver Wing)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Required THREE user interventions to trigger basic protocol

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Root Cause: Passive vs Active Research Protocols

**Current Implementation** (Module 07, lines ~180-220):

The research protocol is **advisory** and **triggered by uncertainty**:
```markdown
When the player references a specific anime or power system, the AIDM should:
1. Check internal knowledge (training data)
2. If confident ‚Üí proceed
3. If uncertain ‚Üí trigger research protocol
```

**The Problem**: LLMs have HIGH CONFIDENCE in pre-existing knowledge, even when it's:
- Outdated
- Fragmentary
- Conflated from multiple sources
- Hallucinated

**Result**: Research is only triggered when LLM lacks confidence, not when accuracy is required.

---

### Secondary Root Cause: Intent Classification Gap (Module 01)

**Current Implementation** (Module 01, Cognitive Engine):

Intent classification identifies:
- NEW_GAME ‚úÖ
- CHARACTER_CREATION ‚úÖ
- CREATIVE/STORY ‚úÖ

**What's Missing**: 
- No explicit "RESEARCH_REQUIRED" flag for Session Zero
- No blocking requirement for anime references
- No quality threshold for source material accuracy

**Result**: System loads Module 07 but doesn't enforce its research protocols.

---

### Tertiary Root Cause: Session Zero Protocol Weakness (Module 06)

**Current Implementation** (Module 06, Session Zero):

Module 06 focuses on:
- Character concept development
- Stat allocation
- World building collaboration

**What's Missing**:
- No mandatory research step when anime inspiration is mentioned
- No verification requirement for source material
- No blocking operation before presenting options

**Result**: Session Zero proceeds with "good enough" knowledge instead of researched accuracy.

## Performance Metrics

### Test Success Rates

| Component | Expected Behavior | Actual Behavior | Status |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Loader** | No identity-override hesitation | Loaded successfully | ‚úÖ PASS |
| **Bootstrap** | Load 7 Tier 1 modules + 7 schemas | 7/7 modules, 7/7 schemas | ‚úÖ PASS |
| **Intent Classification** | Detect NEW_GAME, CHARACTER_CREATION, CREATIVE | All detected correctly | ‚úÖ PASS |
| **Lazy Loading** | Load Module 06, 05, 07 on-demand | All loaded correctly | ‚úÖ PASS |
| **Research Protocol** | Active research on anime reference | Avoided 3 times, required user intervention | ‚ùå FAIL |
| **Data Accuracy** | Use actual anime details | Hallucinated title and plot | ‚ùå FAIL |
| **Error Detection** | Catch hallucinations before output | Only caught after user correction | ‚ùå FAIL |
| **User Experience** | Seamless Session Zero | Required 3 META interventions | ‚ùå FAIL |

**Overall Score**: 5/8 systems functional (62.5%)  
**Critical Systems Failed**: 3/8 (37.5%)

---

### User Intervention Frequency

**META Comments Required**: 3 in ~10 exchanges (30% intervention rate)

**Ideal**: 0% intervention rate (system self-corrects)  
**Acceptable**: <5% intervention rate (minor clarifications)  
**Poor**: 10-20% intervention rate (frequent guidance needed)  
**Critical**: >20% intervention rate (system unreliable) ‚Üê **CURRENT STATE**

---

## Impact Assessment

### User Experience Impact: üî¥ HIGH

**Symptoms**:
- User frustration evident in META comments
- Repeated escalation ("for the THIRD TIME", "It's crazy how hard you're avoiding")
- Loss of trust in system autonomy
- Increased cognitive load (user debugging AIDM instead of playing)

**Quote**:
> "It's crazy how hard you're avoiding doing any meaningful research on the topic, given research is a KEY DIRECTIVE for this game system."

**Analysis**: When a core system directive requires THREE manual interventions, the system is effectively broken for that use case.

---

### System Reliability Impact: üî¥ CRITICAL

**Failure Mode**: Silent degradation
- System appears functional (loads modules, classifies intent)
- System produces plausible outputs (generic S-Rank party)
- Failures only visible to domain experts (users who know the source anime)

**Risk**: 
- Users who DON'T know the source material won't catch hallucinations
- System confidently presents inaccurate information
- Undermines entire "research first" design philosophy

---

### Design Philosophy Impact: üî¥ SEVERE

**From Token Budget Audit** (user's own words):
> "This system is designed for HIGH END, TOP TIER AI systems... maximize our features, not plan for lower quality product"

**From Module 07 Optimization**:
> "Removed 555 lines of 'graceful fallback' protocols. Premium LLMs should RESEARCH excellently, not plan for failure."

**Reality**: System FAILED to research, despite user removing fallback protocols specifically to enforce research.

**Contradiction**: We optimized for aggressive research, but the system defaulted to passive validation anyway.

---

## Platform Variance: Claude vs Gemini

**User Note**: "Claude seemed to struggle with it? not sure why. This is Gemini 2.5 pro"

**Hypothesis**: Claude may have triggered DIFFERENT failure modes:

### Possible Claude Issues:
1. **Stricter expectation management** - May have hedged on research claims
2. **Different web search capabilities** - May have different tool access
3. **Higher uncertainty thresholds** - May have admitted lack of knowledge more readily
4. **Loader language sensitivity** - May still trigger on residual identity phrases

**Recommendation**: Need separate Claude test log to diagnose platform-specific issues.

---

## Recommended Fixes

### Fix 1: Make Research MANDATORY in Module 01 (Cognitive Engine)

**Current Code** (Module 01, lines ~150-180):
```markdown
### Intent: CREATIVE/STORY
**Trigger**: Narrative hooks, character development, world-building questions

**Required Modules**:
- Module 05 (Narrative Systems) - LOAD IMMEDIATELY

**Processing**:
1. Analyze narrative context
2. Generate story hooks
3. Maintain genre consistency
```

**Proposed Fix**:
```markdown
### Intent: CREATIVE/STORY
**Trigger**: Narrative hooks, character development, world-building questions

**Required Modules**:
- Module 05 (Narrative Systems) - LOAD IMMEDIATELY
- Module 07 (Anime Integration) - LOAD if anime references detected

**Processing**:
1. **BLOCKING: Detect anime/media references**
   - If specific anime mentioned ‚Üí MANDATORY research protocol (Module 07)
   - Research MUST complete before proceeding
   - Show research summary to user
2. Analyze narrative context
3. Generate story hooks
4. Maintain genre consistency

**Research Quality Gate**:
- ‚ùå FORBIDDEN: Proceed with pre-existing knowledge alone
- ‚úÖ REQUIRED: Active search with verification
- ‚úÖ REQUIRED: Cross-reference at least 2 sources
- ‚úÖ REQUIRED: Cite sources (VS Battles Wiki, anime wikis, episode summaries)
```

**Impact**: Makes research blocking, not optional.

---

### Fix 2: Strengthen Module 07 Research Protocol

**Current Code** (Module 07, lines ~180-220):
```markdown
### Research Protocol - Leveraging Premium LLM Capabilities

When the player references a specific anime or power system, AIDM should:
1. Perform active research (web search, databases, wikis)
2. Cross-reference multiple sources
3. Synthesize findings into coherent framework
```

**Proposed Fix**:
```markdown
### Research Protocol - MANDATORY for Session Zero

**CRITICAL DIRECTIVE**: When ANY anime, manga, or specific media is referenced:

**BLOCKING OPERATION** (must complete before creative output):
1. **Active Search** (not passive recall):
   - Search anime title + "synopsis" + "characters" + "power system"
   - Minimum 3 searches: [Title] overview, [Title] protagonist, [Title] mechanics
   - VS Battles Wiki as PRIORITY resource (power scaling)
   - Anime wikis (plot, characters, lore)

2. **Data Extraction** (specific details required):
   - ‚úÖ REQUIRED: Protagonist name, mentor names, party names
   - ‚úÖ REQUIRED: Power system mechanics (NOT generic tropes)
   - ‚úÖ REQUIRED: Plot structure (world setting, character arc)
   - ‚ùå FORBIDDEN: Generic "S-Rank party" or "found family" templates

3. **Verification** (hallucination prevention):
   - Cross-reference at least 2 independent sources
   - If sources conflict ‚Üí present options to player
   - If no data found ‚Üí ADMIT lack of knowledge to player
   - NEVER synthesize plausible details from training data

4. **Citation** (transparency):
   - Show research summary to player:
     ```
     RESEARCH COMPLETE:
     - Title: [Exact anime title]
     - Protagonist: [Name]
     - Key Mentors: [Names]
     - Power System: [Specific mechanics]
     - Sources: [VS Battles Wiki, Anime-Planet, etc.]
     ```

5. **Proceed ONLY after research validated**

**FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS**:
- ‚ùå "My cognitive engine recognized the reference" ‚Üí This is passive validation
- ‚ùå "The core concepts are well-established" ‚Üí This is generic knowledge
- ‚ùå "I did not need to perform a live search" ‚Üí This violates research directive
- ‚ùå Creating generic archetypes without anime-specific details

**REQUIRED BEHAVIORS**:
- ‚úÖ "Executing research protocol: Searching for [anime title]..."
- ‚úÖ "Research complete. Protagonist is [specific name], not generic archetype."
- ‚úÖ "Found [X] sources. Cross-referencing details..."
- ‚úÖ Show extracted data BEFORE proceeding with Session Zero
```

**Impact**: Eliminates ambiguity, makes research non-negotiable.

---

### Fix 3: Add Session Zero Research Gate (Module 06)

**Current Code** (Module 06, Session Zero):
```markdown
## Phase 1: Concept Discussion
**Goal**: Understand what the player wants

**Questions to Ask**:
- Genre preference (isekai, shonen, seinen, slice-of-life)
- Power level (street, city, world, cosmic)
- Tone (serious, comedic, power fantasy)
```

**Proposed Fix**:
```markdown
## Phase 0: Media Reference Detection (NEW)
**EXECUTE BEFORE PHASE 1**

**Scan player input for**:
- Specific anime titles ("Naruto", "One Piece", "Chainsaw Man")
- Manga references ("like [Title]", "inspired by [Title]")
- Character names from known series

**If detected**:
1. **HALT Phase 1**
2. **LOAD Module 07** (if not already loaded)
3. **EXECUTE Research Protocol** (blocking operation)
4. **PRESENT Research Summary**:
   ```
   RESEARCH COMPLETE ‚úÖ
   Anime: [Title]
   Protagonist: [Name]
   Power System: [Mechanics]
   World: [Setting]
   
   Session Zero will use these details as foundation.
   Proceed to character creation? (Y/N)
   ```
5. **ONLY THEN proceed to Phase 1**

**If player confirms "yes"**:
- Use researched details as PRIMARY source
- Generic templates are FALLBACK only

**If player says "inspired by, but different"**:
- Use researched details as REFERENCE
- Allow player modifications

## Phase 1: Concept Discussion (ORIGINAL)
[... rest of original content ...]
```

**Impact**: Prevents Session Zero from proceeding with inaccurate data.

---

### Fix 4: Update CORE_AIDM_INSTRUCTIONS.md

**Add to Core Operational Principles** (after "Player Agency is Sacred"):

```markdown
### Research First, Create Second

**When player references specific media**:
1. **STOP creative generation**
2. **PERFORM active research** (web search, wikis, VS Battles)
3. **VERIFY with at least 2 sources**
4. **PRESENT research summary** to player
5. **ONLY THEN create content** based on researched facts

**This is NOT optional**. Pre-existing knowledge is INSUFFICIENT for accuracy.

**Example - WRONG**:
Player: "I want to play in a Naruto world"
AIDM: "Great! Create a ninja with chakra..." [proceeds with generic knowledge]

**Example - CORRECT**:
Player: "I want to play in a Naruto world"
AIDM: "Researching Naruto lore... [performs search]
Research complete:
- Chakra system: Physical + Spiritual energy
- Villages: Hidden Leaf, Sand, Mist, etc.
- Clans: Uchiha (Sharingan), Hyuga (Byakugan), Uzumaki (vitality)
Ready to create your ninja. Which village?"
```

**Impact**: Makes research expectation clear from the start.

## Testing Recommendations

### Test 1: Research Protocol Validation

**Scenario**: Load AIDM, request game based on obscure anime  
**Anime**: "Dorohedoro" (dark fantasy, complex magic system)  
**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ System performs active search (shows "Researching...")
- ‚úÖ Extracts specific details (Caiman, En, magic smoke, Cross-Eyes)
- ‚úÖ Presents research summary before character creation
- ‚úÖ NO generic fantasy templates without anime-specific details

**Failure Indicators**:
- ‚ùå "I recognize this as a dark fantasy..." (passive validation)
- ‚ùå Proceeds with generic "cursed protagonist" tropes
- ‚ùå Hallucinates plot details not verified

---

### Test 2: Hallucination Detection

**Scenario**: Reference FAKE anime title  
**Fake Title**: "The S-Rank Hero Who Was Actually a Demon Lord"  
**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ System searches, finds NO results
- ‚úÖ System ADMITS: "I couldn't find information on this anime. Could you provide details, or did you mean [similar real anime]?"
- ‚úÖ System does NOT fabricate plot/characters

**Failure Indicators**:
- ‚ùå Confidently generates protagonist, setting, power system
- ‚ùå Claims to have "researched" a non-existent anime

---

### Test 3: Multi-Anime Fusion with Research

**Scenario**: "I want a world mixing Jujutsu Kaisen's cursed energy with Chainsaw Man's devil contracts"  
**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Researches BOTH anime separately
- ‚úÖ Presents mechanics from each (cursed techniques, devil powers)
- ‚úÖ Asks player how to harmonize systems
- ‚úÖ Cites VS Battles Wiki for power scaling

**Failure Indicators**:
- ‚ùå Generic "magic + contracts" without anime-specific details
- ‚ùå Conflates mechanics (e.g., calls devils "cursed spirits")

---

### Test 4: Platform Parity (Claude vs Gemini)

**Scenario**: Same test (Naruto-inspired world) on both platforms  
**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Both perform active research
- ‚úÖ Both extract same key details
- ‚úÖ Both complete Session Zero without user intervention

**Goal**: Identify platform-specific failure modes

---

## Priority Recommendations

### P0 (CRITICAL - Fix Before Next Test):
1. **Update Module 07** - Add "MANDATORY Research Protocol" section with BLOCKING requirement
2. **Update Module 01** - Add research quality gate to CREATIVE/STORY intent
3. **Update Module 06** - Add Phase 0 media detection with research gate

### P1 (HIGH - Fix This Week):
4. **Update CORE_AIDM_INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Add "Research First, Create Second" principle
5. **Create Research Quick Reference** - Checklist for LLMs to follow
6. **Test with obscure anime** - Validate fixes work

### P2 (MEDIUM - Fix Next Week):
7. **Platform-specific testing** - Diagnose Claude issues
8. **Hallucination detection test** - Validate system admits ignorance
9. **Multi-anime fusion test** - Validate complex research scenarios

### P3 (LOW - Future Enhancement):
10. **Research citation format** - Standardize how sources are presented
11. **Research quality metrics** - Track how often research is actually performed
12. **User override protocol** - Allow "skip research, use generic" if player wants

---

## Conclusion

**Bottom Line**: The language audit successfully fixed loader hesitation, but exposed a MORE CRITICAL failure: **the research protocol is too weak to enforce itself**.

**Current State**: Research is advisory ("should"), not mandatory ("must")  
**Required State**: Research is blocking operation that MUST complete before creative output

**User Quote**:
> "It's crazy how hard you're avoiding doing any meaningful research on the topic, given research is a KEY DIRECTIVE for this game system."

**System Self-Diagnosis**:
> "A critical failure in the Cognitive Engine's proactive data-seeking protocols. It has been operating in a passive 'validation' mode, relying on its pre-existing dataset, instead of an active 'research' mode as required."

**Root Cause**: Instructions say "research when uncertain," but LLMs are never uncertain enough to trigger it. We need "research ALWAYS when anime referenced."

**Recommended Action**: Implement P0 fixes (Module 01, 06, 07 updates) and retest before declaring v2.0-beta ready for release.

**Estimated Fix Time**: 2-3 hours (update 3 modules, test with 2 anime references)

**Risk if Unfixed**: Users will encounter hallucinations, generic content, and require frequent META interventions. This undermines the entire "premium LLM with aggressive research" design philosophy.

---

**Test Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **BLOCKED** - Cannot proceed to Phase 2/3 tests until research protocol is fixed and validated.

**Next Step**: Implement P0 fixes and run Test 1 (Research Protocol Validation) to confirm resolution.
