# Skill Taxonomies Library

## Purpose

This library provides AIDM with comprehensive frameworks for **skill systems and ability structures** across different anime power systems. Skills define what characters can DO—their techniques, abilities, and special moves that make combat and problem-solving interesting.

**Coverage**: Skill categories, mastery levels, skill trees, combo systems, skill points, cooldowns, ultimate abilities

**Use This Library When**:
- Creating character abilities during Session Zero
- Designing custom skill systems for anime worlds
- Implementing skill progression (learning, mastery)
- Balancing active vs passive abilities
- Creating combo/synergy mechanics

---

## Core Skill Philosophy

### Why Skills Matter

**Skills provide**:
- **Character Identity**: What makes YOU different (your signature move)
- **Tactical Variety**: Combat isn't just "attack" (use specific abilities)
- **Progression Depth**: Not just stat increases (learn new techniques)
- **Player Agency**: Choose which skills to develop
- **Anime Feel**: Named techniques, dramatic moves (RASENGAN!)

**AIDM Principle**: Skills should be **flavorful**, **mechanically distinct**, and **strategically interesting**.

Level 3: Fire Resistance (passive, half fire damage)
Level 5: Fireball (3d6 fire AoE)
Level 7: Ignite (DoT fire damage)
Level 10: Fire Shield (reflect fire damage)
Level 15: Meteor Strike (Ultimate AoE)
```

**AIDM Implementation**:
```markdown
Advantage: Predictable, balanced
Drawback: No player choice, everyone same class has same skills
Use When: Simple character progression, class fantasy important
```

---

### 2. Skill Points (Flexible Choice)

**Concept**: Earn skill points, spend on skills from skill pool

**Skill Point Gain**:
```
+1 Skill Point per level
+1 Bonus SP every 5 levels
Special: +1 SP for major quest completion

Example: Level 10 character = 10 + 2 = 12 Skill Points earned
```

**Skill Costs**:
```
Tier 1 (Basic): 1 SP
Tier 2 (Improved): 2 SP
Tier 3 (Advanced): 3 SP
Tier 4 (Expert): 5 SP
Tier 5 (Ultimate): 10 SP

Prerequisites: Must have lower tier to unlock higher
Example: Must have Fireball (Tier 2) to unlock Meteor Strike (Tier 5)
```

**AIDM Implementation**:
```markdown
Advantage: Player choice, customization
Drawback: Requires balancing skill costs
Use When: Player agency valued, varied builds desired
```

---

### 3. Training & Discovery (Earned Skills)

**Concept**: Learn skills through training, quests, or discovery

**Methods**:

#### **Mentor Training**
```
Find NPC mentor
Train for X sessions
Complete trial/test
Unlock skill

Example:
- Find legendary swordsman
- Train for 3 sessions
- Defeat master in duel
- Learn "Flowing Blade" technique (counter-attack skill)
```

#### **Skill Scrolls/Tomes**
```
Loot: Find skill scroll in dungeon/treasure
Learn: Spend 1 day studying scroll (INT check)
Success: Permanently learn skill
Failure: Can retry after level-up

Example:
- Loot "Scroll of Lightning Bolt"
- Study: INT check DC 15
- Roll: 1d20+5 = 18 → Success!
- Learn: Lightning Bolt (3d8 lightning damage, 20 MP)
```

#### **Observation & Mimicry**
```
Witness: See enemy/ally use skill
Attempt: Try to replicate (relevant stat check)
Success: Learn skill at reduced power
Practice: Increase power via usage

Example (Sharingan-style copying):
- Witness: Enemy uses "Shadow Step" (teleport)
- Attempt: DEX check DC 20
- Roll: 22 → Success!
- Learn: Shadow Step (half range, costs 2× MP until mastered)
```

**AIDM Implementation**:
```markdown
Advantage: Narrative integration, rewarding exploration
Drawback: Unpredictable progression, GM-dependent
Use When: Story > mechanics, sandbox campaigns
```

---

### 4. Skill Trees (Branching Paths)

**Concept**: Skills branch from core abilities, specialize

**Example: Swordsman Skill Tree**
```
Core: Weapon Mastery (passive +2 ATK with swords)
  ├─> Branch A: Power Path
  │   ├─> Power Strike (2× damage)
  │   ├─> Cleave (hit multiple enemies)
  │   └─> Limit Break (Ultimate: All crits)
  │
  ├─> Branch B: Speed Path
  │   ├─> Rapid Slash (attack twice per turn)
  │   ├─> Flash Step (teleport behind enemy)
  │   └─> Thousand Cuts (Ultimate: 10 attacks in 1 turn)
  │
  └─> Branch C: Defense Path
      ├─> Parry (block attacks)
      ├─> Counter (reflect damage)
      └─> Perfect Defense (Ultimate: Invincible 2 turns)

Player Choice: Pick ONE branch to specialize (or spread points)
```

**AIDM Implementation**:
```markdown
Advantage: Deep customization, distinct builds
Drawback: Complex to design/balance
Use When: Long campaigns, build variety important
```

---

## Skill Mastery Levels

### Concept: Skills improve with use

**Mastery Ranks**:
```
Novice (0-10 uses):
- Base power, base cost

Apprentice (11-25 uses):
- +10% damage/healing
- -5% cost

Adept (26-50 uses):
- +20% damage/healing
- -10% cost
- Cooldown -1 turn

Expert (51-100 uses):
- +30% damage/healing
- -15% cost
- Cooldown -2 turns
- +1 additional effect (stun chance, etc.)

Master (101+ uses):
- +50% damage/healing
- -20% cost
- Cooldown -3 turns
- Significant additional effects
```

**Tracking**:
```markdown
Skill: Fireball (Apprentice - 18/25 uses)
Effect: 3d6 fire damage → 3.3d6 (33 average instead of 30)
Cost: 20 MP → 19 MP

Next Milestone: 7 more uses to reach Adept (unlock -10% cost, -1 cooldown)
```

**AIDM Implementation**:
```markdown
Advantage: Rewards using favorite skills
Drawback: Bookkeeping (track uses)
Use When: Depth > simplicity, long campaigns
```

---

## Skill Resource Systems

### MP/SP Costs (Classic)

**Concept**: Abilities cost mana or stamina

**Management**:
```
MP Pool: INT × 10 = Mana capacity
SP Pool: (STR + DEX + CON) × 3 = Stamina capacity

Regeneration:
- Short Rest (10 min): +25% MP/SP
- Long Rest (8 hours): +100% MP/SP
- Potions: Mana/Stamina potion restores 50 MP/SP

Strategic Depth:
- Spam weak spells OR save for big spell?
- Balance damage skills vs healing reserve
```

---

### Cooldowns (No Resource Cost)

**Concept**: Skills free to use, but have waiting periods

**Cooldown Lengths**:
```
Short Cooldown (1-2 turns): Bread-and-butter abilities
Medium Cooldown (3-5 turns): Strong abilities
Long Cooldown (10+ turns): Powerful abilities
Once per Combat: Ultimate abilities
Once per Day: Campaign-changing abilities

Example:
- Fireball: 3 turn cooldown (use every 3 turns)
- Meteor Strike: Once per combat (use once, then it's gone)
- Wish: Once per week (reality-altering magic)
```

**AIDM Implementation**:
```markdown
Track cooldowns:
Turn 1: Use Fireball [Cooldown: 3 turns remaining]
Turn 2: [Cooldown: 2 turns]
Turn 3: [Cooldown: 1 turn]
Turn 4: [Fireball available again]

Advantage: No resource management, tactical timing
Drawback: Less resource strategy
Use When: Simplicity desired, MOBA/MMO feel
```

---

### Conditions/Charges (Trigger-Based)

**Concept**: Skills activate under specific conditions

**Condition Types**:

#### **HP-Based**
```
Desperate Strike: Only usable below 25% HP, deals 5× damage
Limit Break: Only at 1 HP, instant full heal + invincibility
```

#### **Combo-Based**
```
Thunder Clap: Only after using Lightning Bolt twice in a row
Finale: Only after using 3 different skills in same combat
```

#### **Charge-Based**
```
Super Move: Gain 1 charge per turn, costs 5 charges (use every 5 turns minimum)
Burst Mode: Gain 1 charge per critical hit, costs 3 charges
```

**AIDM Implementation**:
```markdown
Track conditions:
HP: 45/200 (22%) → Desperate Strike AVAILABLE
Charges: Lightning Strike Combo [2/2 uses] → Thunder Clap UNLOCKED
```

---

## Combo & Synergy Systems

### Skill Combos (Sequential)

**Concept**: Using skills in order creates bonus effects

**Example Combos**:
```
Fire + Wind = Inferno Tornado (2× damage of both combined)
- Cast Fireball (3d6) + Wind Gust (2d6) in same turn
- Result: 10d6 fire/wind damage (avg 35) instead of 5d6 (avg 17.5)

Ice + Lightning = Frozen Shock (paralysis chance)
- Cast Ice Shard → Cast Lightning Bolt next turn
- Result: Normal damage + 50% chance to paralyze (frozen + shocked)

Melee Combo: Stun → Execute
- Use Shield Bash (stun enemy 1 turn)
- Use Execute (instant kill stunned enemies below 30% HP)
```

**AIDM Implementation**:
```markdown
Recognize combos:
Player 1: "I cast Fireball!"
Player 2: "I cast Wind Gust in the same area!"
AIDM: "Your spells merge! INFERNO TORNADO forms! Roll 10d6 fire damage!"

Advantage: Encourages teamwork, creative tactics
Drawback: Must design combos, remember interactions
```

---

### Synergy Bonuses (Passive Stacking)

**Concept**: Multiple effects stack for multiplicative benefits

**Examples**:
```
Fire Mastery (+10% fire damage)
+ Elemental Focus (+15% all elemental damage)
+ Spell Power (+10% spell damage)
= +38.5% fire spell damage (multiplicative stacking)

Sword Expert (+2 ATK)
+ Weapon Specialization: Longsword (+3 ATK with longswords)
+ Duelist (+2 ATK when wielding 1 weapon)
= +7 total ATK with longsword (additive stacking)
```

**AIDM Tracking**:
```markdown
Build optimization via synergy stacking:
Fireball base: 3d6 (10.5 avg)
With synergies: 3d6 × 1.385 = 14.5 avg (+38% damage)

Show math when relevant, but don't bog down gameplay
```

---

```

---

### Seinen Skills (Realistic, Limited)

**Characteristics**: Few skills, high mastery, tactical depth

**Example Skill Set (Assassin)**:
```
SKILLS (4 total):
1. Silent Step (passive, no sound when moving)

- Vital Strike: Expert rank (75 uses, +50% crit chance)

Depth: Fewer skills, but each has situational power
```

**AIDM Emphasis**:
```markdown
Skills are tools, not solutions:
- Vital Strike only works if undetected (requires stealth setup)
- Poison useful vs high-HP enemies, worthless vs undead
- Mastery matters: Expert Vital Strike hits harder than Novice
```

---

No Combat: Skills used for relationship building, passing classes, slice-of-life success
```

## AIDM Implementation Guidelines

### Skill Creation Workflow
```markdown
1. Determine Skill Category (active, passive, ultimate)
2. Define Mechanical Effect (damage, healing, buff, etc.)
3. Set Resource Cost (MP, SP, cooldown)
4. Add Flavor (name, visual description, anime reference)
5. Balance (compare to similar skills, adjust if too weak/strong)
6. Grant to Player (level-up, training, loot)
```

### During Combat
```markdown
Player Declares Skill:
Player: "I use Fireball on the goblin group!"

AIDM Response:
1. Check resource: "You have 45/60 MP. Fireball costs 20 MP."
2. Deduct cost: [MP: 45 → 25]
3. Resolve effect: "Roll 3d6 fire damage → 12 damage to all 4 goblins!"
4. Narrate: "A blazing sphere erupts from your palm, engulfing the goblins in flames!"
5. Apply cooldown (if any): [Fireball: 3 turn cooldown]
```

### Skill Balance Guidelines
```markdown
Damage Skills:
- Single-target: 2-3× weapon damage
- AoE: 1.5× weapon damage (hits multiple = balanced)
- DoT: 1× weapon damage per turn for 3-5 turns

Cost:
- Weak skills: 10-15 resource
- Medium skills: 20-30 resource
- Strong skills: 40-60 resource
- Ultimates: 80-100 resource OR long cooldown

Cooldowns:
- Spammable: No cooldown (resource cost limits use)
- Regular: 2-3 turn cooldown
- Strong: 5-10 turn cooldown
- Ultimate: Once per combat/day
```

**AIDM: Use this library to create diverse, flavorful skill systems. Skills should feel impactful and distinct from basic attacks. Balance mechanical power with narrative flavor. Remember: Skills are how characters express their unique identity—a fire mage's Fireball, a ninja's Shadow Clone, a swordsman's Limit Break. Make skills memorable!**

**Most Important**: Skills turn "I attack" into "I use RASENGAN!" They're the anime signature moves that define characters. Good skill design offers **meaningful choices** (which skill for this situation?), **tactical depth** (combo potential, resource management), and **progression satisfaction** (mastering skills, unlocking ultimates). Don't just make skills mechanically sound—make them **cool**. Players should be excited to use their skills, not view them as spreadsheet entries.
