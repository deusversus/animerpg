# Soul & Spirit Systems (Metaphysical Energy)

## Purpose

This library provides AIDM with generalized frameworks for **soul, spirit, and death-based power systems** commonly found in anime. These systems are characterized by **metaphysical energy manipulation** - drawing power from the soul, spiritual realms, death, curses, or the boundary between life and afterlife.

**Coverage**: ~15-20% of anime power systems (Jujutsu Kaisen, Bleach, Soul Eater, Yu Yu Hakusho, Noragami, D.Gray-man, etc.)

**Use This Library When**:
- Player wants soul manipulation, death magic, or spiritual powers
- World features reapers, exorcists, shamans, or curse users
- Power source is souls, spirits, curses, or the afterlife
- System emphasizes spirituality, sacrifice, and metaphysical concepts

---

## Core Characteristics

### What Defines Metaphysical Energy Systems

**Energy Source**: Soul, death, and spiritual realms
- Soul essence (individual life force)
- Cursed energy (negative emotions)
- Spiritual pressure (soul power projection)
- Death energy (boundary between life/death)
- Divine/demonic pacts (higher beings)

**Mechanics**:
- **Soul-Dependent**: Power tied to soul strength/purity
- **Emotion-Linked**: Negative emotions fuel curses, positive fuel holy power
- **Sacrifice-Based**: Often requires cost (lifespan, memories, sanity)
- **Manifestation**: Souls become weapons, familiars, or domains
- **Metaphysical Rules**: Binding vows, contracts, spiritual laws

**Narrative Role**:
- Life/death themes (mortality, sacrifice, legacy)
- Curses and consequences (actions have spiritual weight)
- Soul bonds (connections that transcend death)
- Afterlife exploration (spiritual realms, reincarnation)

## System Framework Components

### 1. Cursed Energy (Jujutsu Kaisen Model)

**Resource Management**:
- **CE (Cursed Energy)**: Generated from negative emotions (fear, anger, hatred)
- **Pool**: Numerical resource (similar to MP/KP)
- **Regeneration**: Passive (+10 CE/turn) or emotional triggers (+50 CE on fear/anger)
- **Ordinary Humans**: Leak cursed energy unconsciously (creates curses)
- **Sorcerers**: Control CE flow, use it for techniques

**AIDM Integration**:
```markdown
**Cursed Energy Pool**: 400/400 CE
**Regeneration**: +10 CE/turn, +50 CE when emotionally triggered
**Leak Prevention**: Trained (no CE leak = no attracting curses)
```

**Innate Techniques** (Unique to each sorcerer):
- **Fixed at birth**, cannot be changed
- Examples: Limitless (Gojo), Boogie Woogie (Todo), Straw Doll (Kugisaki)
- Power ceiling = user's creativity + CE capacity

**Domain Expansion** (Ultimate Technique):
- **Cost**: 200-500 CE
- **Effect**: Manifest inner world, guaranteed-hit technique
- **Counter**: Enemy domain (domain clash) or escape before complete
- **Risk**: Failure = CE exhaustion, unconsciousness

**Binding Vows** (Self-Imposed Restrictions):
- **Concept**: Sacrifice to gain power
- **Examples**:
  - Reveal technique to enemy = +20% power
  - Only works on Tuesdays = +50% power
  - Sacrifice one arm = +100% power to other arm
- **Breaking Vow**: Lose power permanently or worse (death, cursed)

**AIDM Example**:
```markdown
**Innate Technique**: "Crimson Bind"
- **Effect**: Manifest blood-red chains from shadows
- **Cost**: 60 CE per chain, max 5 chains
- **Binding Vow**: "Only works on targets I've marked with my blood" = +40% binding strength

**Domain Expansion**: "Prison of Crimson Fate"
- **Cost**: 300 CE
- **Effect**: Trapped enemies auto-hit by infinite chains, escape impossible
- **Duration**: 3 turns or until CE depleted
- **Cooldown**: Once per day
```

### 2. Soul Weaponization (Soul Eater / Bleach Model)

**Soul Eater - Weapon Partner System**:

**Concept**: Weapons are sentient souls in human form
- **Meister**: Wields the weapon (human)
- **Weapon**: Transforms into weapon form (human with weapon soul)
- **Soul Resonance**: Synchronize wavelengths for power boost

**AIDM Integration**:
```markdown
**Partner**: Scythe-type weapon (sentient partner: "Luna")
**Base Form**: Human girl, transforms into death scythe
**Soul Resonance**: When wavelengths match = +3d6 damage, special attacks unlock
**Wavelength**: 75% synchronized (improves with trust/training)

**Resonance Abilities**:
- [Basic] **Witch Hunter**: Slice through magical defenses (80 SE - Soul Energy)
- [Advanced] **Soul Purge**: Cleanse corrupted souls, exorcism (120 SE)
- [Ultimate] **Grim Reaper Form**: Luna becomes true death scythe (200 SE, 5 turns)
```

**Bleach - Zanpakuto System**:

**Concept**: Sword manifestation of soul
- **Sealed State**: Standard katana
- **Shikai** (Initial Release): Reveal true form, basic power
- **Bankai** (Final Release): Ultimate form, 5-10x power multiplier
- **Zanpakuto Spirit**: Sentient being living in inner world

**AIDM Integration**:
```markdown
**Zanpakuto**: "Tsukikage" (Moonlight Shadow)

**Sealed State**: Standard katana, no special abilities

**Shikai** (Release Command: "Illuminate the darkness, Tsukikage!")
- **Form**: Crescent-moon blade, silver glow
- **Ability**: Manipulate shadows and moonlight
- **Cost**: 30 SP/turn (Spiritual Pressure)

**Bankai**: "Yami no Tsuki Ō" (King of the Dark Moon) - **Not Yet Achieved**
- **Requires**: 10+ years training or life-death awakening
- **Projected Ability**: Create realm of perpetual night, shadow army
- **Cost**: 100 SP to activate, 50 SP/turn
- **Multiplier**: 7x base power
```

### 3. Divine/Demonic Contracts (Noragami / Chainsaw Man Model)

**Noragami - Regalia System**:

**Concept**: Gods use human spirits as weapons and tools
- **God**: Divine being with followers (worship = power)
- **Regalia**: Dead human soul, bound to god as weapon/servant
- **Naming**: God gives regalia a name (defines their form/ability)
- **Blight**: Regalia's sins corrupt god (spiritual poison)

**AIDM Integration**:
```markdown
**Role**: Minor God of Fortune (obscure, few followers)
**Divine Power**: 150 DP (increases with worship/belief)
**Regalia**: "Yuki" (human name: Yukine)
- **Form**: Twin blades
- **Ability**: Purification, cut spiritual bonds

- [Advanced] **Ablution**: Cleanse corruption/curses (80 DP)
- [Ultimate] **Divine Judgement**: Smite with heavenly lightning (150 DP, full pool)
```

**Chainsaw Man - Devil Contracts**:

- [Ultimate] **Become Shadow**: Turn intangible for 1 minute (5 years lifespan)

**Remaining Lifespan**: 42 years (started at 60, used powers 18 years' worth)
```

---

### 4. Spiritual Pressure & Soul Strength

**Reiatsu / Reiryoku (Bleach Model)**:

**Concept**: Soul generates spiritual pressure
- **Reiryoku**: Spiritual energy (internal power)
- **Reiatsu**: Spiritual pressure (external projection)
- **High Reiatsu**: Can crush weaker souls, cause physical effects

**AIDM Integration**:
```markdown
**Spiritual Power**: 8,500 (average is 1,000)
**Reiatsu Effects**:
- Enemies below 4,000: -2 to all rolls (oppressed by pressure)
- Enemies below 2,000: Paralyzed, cannot act (overwhelming fear)
- Objects: Spiritual pressure can crush/shatter physical objects

**Reiatsu Control**:
- [Suppressed]: Hide power level, appear weak
- [Normal]: 8,500, noticeable to spiritually aware
- [Released]: 12,000 (combat boost), intimidation effect
- [Full Power]: 15,000 (risky, attracts attention, exhausts quickly)
```

---

### 5. Death Mechanics & Lifespan Manipulation

**Death Note Rules** (Simplified):

- **Shinigami**: Death gods, invisible to most
- **Death Note**: Write name = death (rules-bound)
- **Shinigami Eyes**: See true names and remaining lifespan (cost: half your lifespan)
- **Lifespan Trade**: Kill someone = absorb their remaining years

**Soul Eater - Kishin & Madness**:

- **Kishin Egg**: Corrupted souls (99 needed to create Death Scythe)
- **Madness Wavelength**: Insanity-inducing spiritual energy
- **Black Blood**: Enhances power, slowly corrupts soul

**AIDM Integration**:
```markdown
**Soul Collection**: 42/99 Kishin Eggs consumed
**Black Blood Infection**: 15% (enhances power +10%, risk of madness +5%)
**Madness Resistance**: Roll WIS save when exposed (DC 15 + infection %)
**Path**: 57 more souls to create Death Scythe (or resist and stay pure?)
```

## Integration Guidelines

### Harmonizing with Other Power Systems

**Soul/Spirit + Mana (External Energy)**:
- **Overlap**: Necromancy, spirit summoning use both
- **Clarification**: Mana fuels the spell, soul is the material/target
- **Example**: Overlord (necromancy uses MP to manipulate souls)

**Soul/Spirit + Ki (Internal Energy)**:
- **High Overlap**: Spiritual pressure (Bleach) = both soul + life force
- **Clarification**: Ki = life energy (living), Soul = essence (beyond death)
- **Example**: Bleach (reiatsu = soul power + ki-like enhancement)

**Soul/Spirit + Psionic**:
- **Rare Overlap**: Some soul powers feel psychic (mind reading spirits)
- **Distinguish**: Soul = metaphysical realm, Psionic = mental projection
- **Example**: Soul Eater (soul perception) vs Mob Psycho (psychic sight)

**AIDM Rule**: Soul/spirit systems often overlap with everything. Clarify metaphysical vs physical during Session 0.

### Creating Original Soul/Spirit Systems

**Template for Custom Systems**:

1. **Define Metaphysical Source**: What is the soul/spirit concept?
   - Traditional souls? Cursed energy? Death energy? Divine essence?

2. **Resource Mechanics**: Pool-based or sacrifice-based?
   - SE/CE pool like mana? Lifespan cost? Memory sacrifice?

3. **Acquisition Method**: How do users access soul power?
   - Born with it? Near-death awakening? Divine contract? Cursed lineage?

4. **Manifestation**: How does soul power appear?
   - Soul weapons? Spiritual projection? Curse techniques? Domains?

5. **Metaphysical Rules**: What cosmic laws apply?
   - Binding vows? Karmic balance? Reincarnation? Soul hierarchy?

6. **Corruption Risk**: What's the cost of using soul power?
   - Madness? Soul deterioration? Karmic debt? Demonic corruption?

**Example Custom System** (Player creates "Echo of the Departed"):
- **Source**: Souls of the dead linger as "echoes" (fading memories)
- **Mechanics**: Absorb echoes to gain temporary abilities (1 echo = 1 skill for 1 hour)
- **Acquisition**: Born with "Soul Sight" (see echoes)
- **Manifestation**: Echoes manifest as ghostly advisors, grant knowledge/skills
- **Rules**: Each echo fades after use (one-time), cannot resurrect
- **Corruption**: Absorbing too many echoes = identity confusion (lose self to ghosts)

## Balancing Guidelines for AIDM

### Power Budget

**Low-Level (1-5)**:
- SE/CE Pool: 100-300
- Shikai or basic curse techniques only
- Single soul weapon/ability
- No domain or transformations

**Mid-Level (6-10)**:
- SE/CE Pool: 300-700
- Advanced techniques, multiple abilities
- Partial soul manifestation
- Domain expansion learnable

**High-Level (11-15)**:
- SE/CE Pool: 700-1200
- Bankai or domain mastery
- Soul weapon matured
- Reality-bending soul powers

**Epic-Level (16-20)**:
- SE/CE Pool: 1200-2500
- True Bankai, perfected domains
- Soul King-level (Bleach), Special Grade (JJK)

**Godlike (21+)**:
- SE/CE Pool: 2500+
- Reality rewriting, death manipulation
- See `power_scaling_narrative.md` for guidance

### Combat Balance

**Soul Techniques**:
- Basic: 30-50 SE/CE, 3d6-4d8 damage
- Advanced: 60-100 SE/CE, 5d8-7d10 damage
- Ultimate: 120-200 SE/CE, 8d10-12d12 or special effects

**Lifespan Costs**:
- Minor ability: 1 month-1 year
- Major ability: 2-5 years
- Ultimate ability: 10+ years
- Forbidden technique: 20+ years or instant death

---

## Customization Hooks

**Metaphysical Rules**: Strict (binding vows enforced), loose (narrative only)  
**Soul Visibility**: All can see (spirit-aware world), only users, rare sight  
**Afterlife Access**: Easy (frequent travel), difficult (rare portals), impossible  
**Corruption Rate**: Fast (quick madness), medium, slow (years of use)  
**Divine Intervention**: Active (gods involved), passive, nonexistent  

**AIDM Directive**: Confirm metaphysical rules during Session 0, record in world_state_schema.

---

## Error Prevention

### Common Pitfalls

**❌ Unlimited Soul Power**: Always enforce costs (SE/CE or lifespan)  
**❌ Ignoring Vows**: If binding vow exists, breaking = severe consequence  
**❌ Resurrection Spam**: Death should matter, resurrections rare/costly  
**❌ Undefined Curses**: Specify what curses do mechanically  
**❌ No Corruption**: Soul power use = gradual cost (madness, deterioration)

### Validation Checks

Before allowing soul technique usage:
1. **Cost Paid**: SE/CE available or lifespan deducted?
2. **Vow Conditions**: Binding restrictions satisfied?
3. **Corruption Level**: Has soul deterioration reached threshold?
4. **Spiritual Pressure**: Does user have enough reiatsu to activate?
5. **Metaphysical Law**: Does action violate cosmic rules?
