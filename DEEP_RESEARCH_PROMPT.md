## System Architecture Overview

### Core Structure

**AIDM v2** is a modular system consisting of:

- **14 Core Modules** (00-13): Cognitive engine, memory, state management, NPCs, narrative systems, combat, progression, dice mechanics, world-building, advanced classes, base-building, guilds, relations, narrative calibration
- **20 Narrative Profiles**: Anime-specific calibration files (Hunter x Hunter, Jujutsu Kaisen, Death Note, Konosuba, Attack on Titan, etc.) defining tone, pacing, dialogue style, combat narratives
- **15 Genre Trope Libraries**: Structural templates for shonen, seinen, isekai, mystery, horror, romance, mecha, sports, etc.
- **8 Schemas**: JSON schemas for session exports, state management, character data, world-building, NPC tracking, inventory, quest logs
- **Supporting Systems**: Lazy-loading architecture, tier-based context management (TIER 1/2/3), auto-loading rules, profile blending, optimization protocols

### Design Philosophy

1. **Lazy-Loading**: Only load 20-30K tokens active at any time (out of 180-200K total library)
2. **Modular Independence**: Each module can function standalone or integrate seamlessly
3. **Narrative Authenticity**: Profiles capture real anime storytelling patterns, not generic fantasy
4. **LLM-Agnostic**: Designed to work with Claude, GPT-4, and future models
5. **Session Persistence**: Full state export/import via JSON schemas
6. **Profile Blending**: Combine 2-3 anime profiles for hybrid genres

### Recent Optimizations (Oct 13, 2025)

- Index files optimized: 62.3% token reduction (16,921 → 6,386 tokens)
- Session Zero load reduced 36.2% (29,100 → 18,565 tokens)
- 100% information parity maintained during compression

## Research Methodology

### Phase 1: Architectural Analysis

**Examine the module structure and interdependencies:**

1. **Module Cohesion**: Are modules properly scoped? Any violations of single responsibility?
2. **Coupling Analysis**: Which modules are tightly coupled? Does this create brittleness?
3. **Lazy-Loading Effectiveness**: Is the TIER 1/2/3 system optimal? Are there better approaches?
4. **Context Management**: How does the 20-30K active token budget hold up under stress?
5. **Module Redundancy**: Are there overlapping responsibilities between modules?
6. **Missing Modules**: What critical systems are absent? (e.g., economy, factions, timekeeping?)
7. **Scalability**: Can the system handle 100+ NPCs? 50+ quests? Complex multi-faction campaigns?
8. **Integration Points**: Where do modules interact? Are these interfaces well-defined?
