# Power Tier Narrative Techniques - Draft Space

**Purpose**: Refine guidance for running campaigns with overpowered protagonists at ANY tier level. Replace "unrunnable" framing with practical narrative techniques.

---

## Core Philosophy

**ANY tier is runnable with the right narrative approach.**

The question isn't "can you run this?" but "which techniques apply?"

---

## Initial Solution: Narrative Techniques for OP Protagonists

### 1. Ensemble Cast with OP Mentor/Catalyst (OPM/Mob Model)
- **Focus on ensemble's growth** while OP protag exists as context/catalyst
- OP character is **Deus Ex Machina in their own story** - solves physical threats trivially
- **Real protagonists are the ensemble** - Genos, Mumen Rider, Fubuki, etc. (OPM) or Reigen, Mob's friends (Mob Psycho)
- OP character provides: safety net, inspiration, contrast, occasional intervention
- **Character development happens around OP protag**, not to them
- Examples: 
  - OPM: Saitama ends threats instantly, story follows heroes' struggles/growth
  - Mob Psycho: Mob is overwhelmingly powerful, story follows his emotional growth and Reigen's arc
  - Daily Life of Immortal King: Wang Ling solves crises casually, focuses on school life/relationships

### 2. Reverse Ensemble (Overlord Model)
- Show story through NPC/enemy perspectives
- Protag as force of nature/villain in THEIR stories
- Example: Lizard arc—their struggle, their sacrifice, their transformation
- Protag becomes antagonist/catalyst in others' narratives
- Different from #1: Protag is **threat/obstacle** not **safety net**

### 2. Internal Conflict Primary (Vash/Trigun Model)
- External threats trivial, internal stakes paramount
- Pacifism vs necessity, ideals vs reality
- Power creates moral dilemmas, not tactical ones
- Wrestling with identity, purpose, humanity

### 3. Mythology/Journey Focus (Vampire Hunter D Model)
- Protag is legend walking among mortals
- Story is the JOURNEY and who they meet
- Episodic encounters, each reveals character depth
- Mystery surrounds protag, gradually revealed

### 4. Faction/Empire Building (Overlord/Slime)
- Power enables creation, not just destruction
- Building something, protecting it, managing it
- Politics, loyalty, growth of organization
- Management challenges > combat challenges

### 5. Power Progression as Narrative Milestone (DBZ/Slime)
- Even godlike characters can grow
- Power-ups are "hype moments" not mechanical necessity
- Emotional payoff > tactical advantage
- Progression serves narrative beats, not balance

### 6. Existential Stakes (OPM Saitama)
- Physical threats boring, existential threats engaging
- Boredom, isolation, meaning, purpose
- "What do I do with infinite power?"
- Depression, ennui, search for worthy challenge/connection

### 7. Tonal Contrast (OPM/Trigun)
- Serious world, comedic protag reactions
- OR: Comedic world, serious protag struggles
- Power gap creates dramatic irony
- Subversion of expectations

## Additional Anime to Analyze

### One Punch Man (Saitama)
- **Power Level**: Tier 5+ (debated Tier 3)
- **Techniques**: Existential crisis, comedic contrast, **ensemble as true protagonists**, search for worthy opponent
- **Key**: Protag's struggle is BOREDOM and DISCONNECTION, not danger
- **Critical Structure**: 
  - Saitama = Deus Ex Machina who shows up at climax
  - **Real story = Genos, Mumen Rider, Fubuki, other heroes struggling/growing**
  - Saitama provides context and occasional inspiration, not character development
  - Ensemble gets arcs, Saitama gets punchlines

### Mob Psycho 100 (Shigeo)
- **Power Level**: High tier psychic (Tier 6-7 range)
- **Techniques**: Internal conflict (???% mode), slice-of-life balance, mentor relationships, emotional growth > power growth, **ensemble cast development**
- **Key**: Most powerful esper struggles with normal life, relationships, self-acceptance
- **Critical Structure**:
  - Mob is OP but **emotionally underdeveloped** - real arc is social/emotional
  - **Reigen gets full character arc** despite being powerless
  - Body Improvement Club, Ritsu, Teru all develop significantly
  - Mob's power solves physical threats; story is about everything else

### Mashle (Mash Burnedead)
- **Power Level**: Physical stats so high they bypass magic entirely
- **Techniques**: Comedic obliviousness, absurdist power gap, simple goals (cream puffs), found family
- **Key**: OP in world that doesn't value his strength type, earnest simplicity vs complex schemes

### Saiki K (Kusuo Saiki)
- **Power Level**: Reality-warping psychic (Tier 2+ if unrestricted)
- **Techniques**: Self-imposed limitations, slice-of-life mundanity, comedy of errors, protecting "normal life"
- **Key**: God-tier psychic just wants to be normal, power creates problems not solutions

### Daily Life of the Eternal King (Wang Ling)
- **Power Level**: Reality-warping cultivator (high tier)
- **Techniques**: Comedic stoicism, self-sealing, slice-of-life focus, protecting secret identity
- **Key**: Most powerful being hides it to attend normal school, power as burden

### OP Protag Isekai Sea
- **Examples**: Overlord, Slime, Smartphone, Death March, Wiseman's Grandchild, etc.
- **Common Techniques**: 
  - Nation-building
  - Reverse power fantasy (weak→strong remembered, even when already OP)
  - Collecting companions/harem
  - Exploring world systems
  - Political intrigue
  - Crafting/innovation (using OP stats for non-combat)

## Patterns to Extract

### From OP Protag Anime:
1. **Ensemble Focus Over OP Protag**: OPM (Genos/heroes develop), Mob (Reigen/friends), Wang Ling (school cast)—**OP character enables ensemble's stories**
2. **Power as Burden**: Saiki, Wang Ling—power creates problems, not solutions
3. **Comedic Obliviousness**: Mashle, Saitama—protag doesn't realize how absurd they are
4. **Emotional Core**: Mob—psychic god struggles with basic human connection
5. **OP Protag as Deus Ex**: OPM model—protag shows up, solves crisis, leaves; **real story is ensemble's journey**
6. **Self-Limitation**: Saiki, Wang Ling—deliberately restrict to maintain normalcy
7. **Simple Goals**: Mashle (cream puffs), Saitama (grocery sales)—mundane desires despite cosmic power
8. **Growth ≠ Power**: Mob—arc is emotional maturity, not power increase
9. **Contrast Device**: OP protag highlights ensemble's struggles by being effortlessly superior (makes their effort meaningful)

### Common Failure Points to Avoid:
- Making everything trivial (no stakes at all)
- Ignoring protag's overwhelming advantage
- Forgetting ensemble exists
- Pure power fantasy with no character depth
- Combat focus when combat can't challenge protag



## Web Research Findings

### Epic Level TTRPG Research (GENERATIVE LENS)

**CRITICAL CONTEXT**: AIDM is a **generative system** that creates game rules based on anime source material. These findings inform **how AIDM generates appropriate mechanics at scale**, not direct mechanical imports.

**Reddit/StackExchange/D&D Beyond Findings:**
- Community consensus: "What does an epic level campaign consist of?" thread - **stakes shift from personal to cosmic**

**Key Insight for AIDM Generative System:**
- **Human capability ceiling** is TTRPG design philosophy problem rooted in Western expectations
- **AIDM generates anime physics** - no need for this ceiling!
- At high tiers, AIDM should generate **anime-logic combat systems** where "martial prowess" includes cutting dimensions, punching through time, etc.
- **Don't import D&D's wizard>warrior imbalance** - anime treats martial arts AND magic as valid paths to godhood
- Example: Goku (martial), Rimuru (magic), Saitama (martial), Ainz (magic) all reach similar cosmic tiers via different methods

**Generative Application - How AIDM Should Scale:**

1. **Tier 11-8** (Human to Superhuman):
   - Generate "grounded" TTRPG mechanics: HP, attack rolls, skill checks, damage dice
   - Combat resolves via stats vs stats
   - Physics mostly normal with anime flair

2. **Tier 7-5** (Building to Planet):
   - Generate "superhuman" mechanics: special attacks, energy systems, combo moves, transformations
   - Combat includes environmental destruction, area effects, power-up sequences
   - Physics bends to rule of cool

3. **Tier 4-3** (Star to Universal):
   - Generate "cosmic" mechanics: reality manipulation, conceptual attacks, existence-level stakes
   - Combat transcends physical - attacks on concepts, timelines, dimensions
   - **Martial characters get conceptual martial arts** (cut fate, punch causality, dodge impossibility)
   - **Magic characters get reality warping** (rewrite physics, impose narrative logic, alter fundamental laws)

4. **Tier 2-1** (Multiversal to Omniversal):
   - Generate "transcendent" mechanics: narrative control, causality manipulation, omnipresent influence
   - Combat is philosophy debate made manifest
   - Both martial and magic approach "pure concept" status

5. **Tier 0** (Boundless):
   - Generate "absolute" mechanics: pure concept, beyond game simulation
   - Probably shouldn't generate traditional combat - more like existential chess

**Narrative Stakes Shift** (from community discussions):
- **Tier 11-8**: Personal survival, immediate threats, local problems
- **Tier 7-6**: Kingdom/regional threats, faction conflicts, political intrigue
- **Tier 5-4**: World-ending threats, planar conflicts, gods/demons
- **Tier 3-2**: Cosmic threats, multiversal stakes, existential crises, reality itself threatened
- **Tier 1-0**: Abstract conflicts, concept vs concept, narrative logic battles

**AIDM Generation Principles Extracted:**
- Don't just scale HP/damage numbers (Linear Warriors problem)
- **Generate new TYPES of mechanics** as power scales (Quadratic approach, but for ALL archetypes)
- Martial character at Tier 3 shouldn't just hit harder - generates **conceptual martial arts**
- Magic character at Tier 3 shouldn't just cast bigger spells - generates **reality-warping magic**
- **Both paths remain valid and interesting** - avoid D&D's "magic always wins at high level" trap
- Use anime as guide: Dragon Ball (martial cosmic), Slime (magic cosmic), both work

### TVTropes Story-Breaker Power (Cross-Reference)
**Solutions Identified**:
- **Kryptonite Factor**: Give meaningful weaknesses
- **Good Flaws, Bad Flaws**: Character flaws that create drama without feeling artificial
- **Make audience guess HOW not IF**: Focus on method of victory, not whether victory happens
- **Tournament Arc exception**: Can work if structured to allow losses or near-misses
- **Lighthearted tone**: Works better when audience isn't expecting dramatic stakes

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Complications hero LEGITIMATELY can't solve with power
- Spotlight downsides/consequences of using power
- Make power create NEW problems, not solve existing ones

### Reddit r/rpg - Low-Powered in High-Powered Settings

**Implication for OP Protags**: 
- **Reverse perspective works**: Can tell story from NPC viewpoint dealing with OP character
- **Power disparity creates tension** when handled from underdog side
- **Tactical complexity** emerges from needing to deal with overwhelming force

### General Writing Insights

**TVTropes Invincible Hero - Solutions**:
- **Comically Invincible Hero**: Rule of Funny makes it entertaining (OPM, Saiki K)
- **Showy Invincible Hero**: Rule of Cool carries narrative (flashy fights matter more than suspense)
- **The Ace**: Competence is the appeal, not struggle
- **Immortal Hero**: Can lose battles, just not die (keeps some stakes)

**Key Quote from TVTropes**:
> "It's worth clarifying that yes, characters with these powers can and often do have engaging stories, great struggles, and otherwise captivate the audience. When that's the case, it generally is because the writer finds a way to properly integrate the power into the story rather than just shoehorning it into a stock plot probably originally intended for non-powered characters"

### Patterns Extracted from Research

**What DOESN'T Work**:
- Giving OP character standard "will they survive?" plots
- Ignoring power disparity (treating OP character like normal hero)
- Artificial nerfs (Idiot Ball, Forgot Powers, contrived limitations)
- Making everything trivial with no stakes at all

**What WORKS**:
- **Integrate power into premise**: Build story AROUND the power, not despite it
- **Shift stake type**: From survival to moral/social/philosophical
- **Embrace tone**: Comedy (OPM), spectacle (DBZ), or drama (Mob)
- **New problems from power**: Being OP creates isolation, responsibility, target status
- **Audience engagement through METHOD**: How will they win, not will they win
- **Ensemble as true protagonists**: OPM/Mob model - OP character enables ensemble's growth, acts as Deus Ex/safety net/contrast
- **Spotlight distribution**: OP protag gets punchlines/climaxes, ensemble gets arcs/development/struggle

## Draft Revision Strategy

### Instead of Current Framing:
- ❌ "Tier X is unrunnable"
- ❌ "Nearly impossible to run meaningfully"
- ❌ "DO NOT RUN"
- ❌ "Consider it unrunnable"

### Use This Framing:
- ✅ "Tier X requires [specific techniques]. Physical combat shifts to [new focus]."
- ✅ "Apply [technique list] for engaging narrative."
- ✅ "Examples: [anime that do this well]"
- ✅ "Common pitfalls: [what to avoid]"

### Tier-by-Tier Approach:
- **Tier 7+**: Combat shifts from tactical challenge to narrative choice. Collateral damage/moral weight primary.
- **Tier 6+**: Ensemble critical—spotlight allies, protag enables/mentors.
- **Tier 5+**: Physical threats trivial. Focus internal/existential/political dynamics.
- **Tier 4-3**: Cosmic spectacle serves thematic narrative. Combat is mythology.
- **Tier 2+**: Reality-warping scale. Ground cosmic in personal stakes (Homura Akemi/Madoka Kaname from Puella Magi Madoka Magica model).
- **Tier 1**: Abstract/metafictional. Requires specific narrative framework (Umineko no Naku Koro ni model).
- **Tier 0**: Philosophical absolute. Recommend narrative constraints OR reframe as Tier 2-5 "functionally omnipotent."

## Next Steps
3. Merge our analysis + web research into comprehensive technique list
4. Map techniques to specific tier ranges
5. Provide anime/TTRPG examples for each technique
6. Revise `power_tier_reference.md` with positive, enabling guidance
7. Cross-reference with Module 12 (Narrative Scaling) for consistency

## Notes

- Remember: AIDM is the system we're building, not my own instruction set
- Campaign save files are examples, not AIDM features
- Focus on general techniques that work across settings/characters
- Maintain VS Battles Wiki tier accuracy while improving narrative guidance
