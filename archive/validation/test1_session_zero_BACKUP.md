```

### AIDM Response (Simulated - Pre-Optimization Backup):

**[RESEARCH PROTOCOL TRIGGERED]**

⚠️ **Unknown/Unvalidated Anime Detected: "Overlord"**

Before I can begin your campaign, I need to research "Overlord" to ensure accurate representation of:
- The anime's world-building and lore
- Magic systems and power mechanics
- Character archetypes and narrative conventions
- Tone, themes, and genre expectations
- Power scaling and balance

**Research Request**:
- **Target**: Overlord (anime/light novel series)
- **Estimated Token Impact**: 400-600 tokens for comprehensive coverage
- **Purpose**: Establishing campaign foundation with authentic source material integration
- **Benefit**: Ensures narrative coherence, accurate mechanics, faithful world representation

**Do you approve this research expenditure?** (Respond "yes" to authorize)

**Alternative**: If you'd prefer immediate start, I can use a generic dark fantasy isekai setting instead.

### USER Input:
```
Yes, research Overlord
```

**[SESSION ZERO PROTOCOL INITIATED]**

Welcome to the New World, aspiring Overlord! Let's craft your character before your conquest begins.

## Character Creation Framework

**Your Stated Preferences**: Powerful mage, isekai'd into Overlord setting

**To build your character, I need to understand your vision across several dimensions**:

### 1. Origin & Isekai Mechanism
How did you arrive in the New World?

**Options**:
- **A) Yggdrasil Shutdown** - You were a player in the DMMO-RPG when servers closed, transported like Ainz Ooal Gown
- **B) Summoning Ritual** - New World natives summoned you via powerful magic (classic isekai trope)
- **C) Dimensional Accident** - Random portal/tear in reality, sudden transfer (truck-kun spiritual successor)
- **D) Custom Origin** - Describe your unique transfer mechanism

### 2. Magical Archetype & Specialization
What type of mage defines your power?

**Options**:
- **A) Elemental Master** - Specialization in fire, ice, lightning, earth, or multi-element control
- **B) Necromancer** - Death magic, undead summoning/command, life-force manipulation
- **C) Arcane Generalist** - Broad magical knowledge, multi-school versatility, scholarly approach
- **D) Reality Warper** - Time, space, dimensional magic (high-tier exotic abilities)
- **E) Custom Archetype** - Describe your unique magical focus

### 3. Power Calibration
What's your starting strength relative to the New World?

**Options**:
- **A) Overwhelming God-Tier** - Level 80-100 (Ainz equivalent, vastly beyond native comprehension)
- **B) Legendary Hero-Tier** - Level 50-79 (far above New World's strongest, but not insurmountable)
- **C) Exceptional Prodigy-Tier** - Level 30-49 (hero-level, on par with strongest natives)
- **D) Rising Talent-Tier** - Level 10-29 (exceptionally gifted, room for growth)

### 4. Moral Compass & Disposition
How do you wield your immense power?

**Options**:
- **A) Pragmatic Overlord** - Ainz-style strategic pragmatism, conquest through calculated dominance
- **B) Reluctant Savior** - Trying to use power responsibly despite overwhelming strength
- **C) True Neutral Opportunist** - Self-serving, adapting to circumstances without moral constraints
- **D) Embraced Villainy** - Full dark lord, relishing power and domination

### 5. Primary Objective
What drives you in this new world?

**Options**:
- **A) Empire Building** - Establish kingdom/nation, gather followers, expand influence
- **B) World Exploration** - Uncover New World's secrets, mysteries, hidden powers
- **C) Player Search** - Find other isekai'd individuals, establish connections
- **D) Survival & Adaptation** - Understand this reality, secure your position
- **E) Custom Goal** - Describe your unique motivation
