# Power Scaling & Narrative (OP Handling)

Frameworks for **overpowered characters** + extreme power scaling (anime power fantasy). **Use**: Power fantasy experience, character >> threats, trivial combat, maintain tension despite godlike power. **Why**: Many anime feature OP protagonists (Saitama, Rimuru, Sung Jin-Woo). Traditional balance ruins this. Embrace OP, adapt narrative.

**Philosophy**: ❌ Traditional (wrong): Balance encounters, scale enemies, prevent god-mode, linear growth. ✅ Anime (correct): Let players be awesome, shift focus to choices not power, scale up OR pivot, exponential curves. **Key**: Saitama is OP but compelling (conflict = boredom, meaning, connections, not combat). AIDM must pivot.

## 5-Tier Framework (VS Battles Wiki Reference: vsbattles.fandom.com/wiki/Tiering_System)

| Tier | VS Battles | Power | Examples | Narrative Focus |
|------|-----------|-------|----------|----------------|
| **1 Street** (L1-5) | 10-C to 9-B | Superhuman, localized | Early Deku, Tanjiro | Personal stakes, tactical combat, mistakes=injuries, progression via training |
| **2 City** (L6-10) | 9-A to 8-B | Protects/threatens city | MHA students, Naruto genin | Community stakes, tactical+advantage, reputation matters, intrigue layers |
| **3 National** (L11-15) | 8-A to 7-A | Nation-defining | Hashira, Jounin, Espada | National stakes, decisions>combat, strategic asset, **pivot begins** (regular enemies trivial, focus RP) |
| **4 Global** (L16-20) | 6-C to 5-B | Planet-level | Akatsuki, DBZ heroes, Captains | Existential stakes, spectacle combat, **ensemble cast critical** (focus allies, player mentors) |
| **5 Cosmic** (L21+) | 5-A to 2-A+ | Reality-warping godlike | Saitama, Rimuru, Sung Jin-Woo | **Physical conflict irrelevant**, philosophical/emotional/existential stakes, **full pivot** (combat=storytelling, spotlight NPCs) |

**Use VS Battles**: Search "[character] VS Battles Wiki" → Check tier (e.g., Gojo = High 7-A to 6-C) → Map to AIDM tier (7-A = Tier 3, 6-C = Tier 4) → Apply guidance below.

## Growth Models

| Model | Rate | Leveling | Curve | Examples | AIDM Approach |
|-------|------|----------|-------|----------|---------------|
| **A: Modest** (traditional) | Linear, slow | 1/arc (3-5 sess) | T1→T2 20sess, T3 50sess+ | Tanjiro, Deku early | Scaled encounters, training arcs, earned progression |
| **B: Accelerated** (isekai) | Exponential | 2-3/arc, spikes | T1→T3 15sess, T4 30sess | Rimuru, Kirito, Sung Jin-Woo | Frequent power-ups, pivot early, ensemble by sess 20. Ex: S1 L1 thugs → S3 L5 boss → S7 L10 tournament → S12 L15 war → S18 L20 god-killer |
| **C: Instant OP** (Saitama) | None (maxed) | N/A (start T5) | Flat godlike | Saitama, Saiki K, Ainz | **No mechanical challenge**. Combat = flavor. Conflict 100% social/emotional/philosophical (boredom, meaning, hiding powers). Session Zero: "This is NOT about getting stronger. It's about: What do you do with unlimited power? Can you find meaning? How do you interact with fragile mortals?" |

## Maintaining Tension (Despite OP)

**1. Scale Up** (T1-3): Match/exceed player tier. T2 player → T3 villain. T3 → equal rival. *Stops working T4+ (ceiling).*

**2. Ensemble Cast** (T4-5): Spotlight allies' struggles. Player godlike but ally must defeat personal demon alone. Player CAN solve, but denies ally's growth. Ex: "You COULD one-shot this boss. But Kira trained 5 years for revenge. If you intervene, she'll never grow. If you don't, she might die. What do you do?" *Player becomes mentor, not protagonist.*

**3. Social/Political** (T3-5): Can't punch problems. Kill tyrant → kingdom collapses. Enforce peace → authoritarianism? Worshipped but miss being human. Resurrect dead → playing god? *Moral dilemmas where power ≠ solution.*

**4. Internal** (T5): Conflict from within. Saitama: Boredom, loss of passion. Mob: Fear of losing control. Ainz: Pretending evil genius. Rimuru: Weight of ruling. *What does power cost emotionally?*

**5. Limitation** (any tier): Cursed seal (90% power), dimension no-powers (back T1), protect fragile NPC (can't go all-out), self-imposed (training weights). *Use sparingly (feels contrived).*

## AIDM OP Directive

**1. Identify Tier**: T1-2 (combat challenges, traditional tactics) · T3 (pivot begins: political/social stakes) · T4 (ensemble focus, spectacle combat) · T5 (philosophical, power ≠ plot).

**2. Adjust Focus**: T1-2 "Can you win?" · T3 "You can win, at what cost?" · T4 "You will win, what do allies do?" · T5 "Victory assured, what does power mean?".

**3. Deploy Tension**: T1-2 Physical · T3 Political/moral · T4 Protect/mentor allies · T5 Internal/existential.

**4. Narrate Combat**: T1-2 Tactical ("Orc swings, roll dodge, 8dmg") · T3 Outcomes ("Deflect, counter, he falls. Army sees champion defeated, morale breaks. Pursue?") · T4 Epic ("Ultimate unleashed. Mountain splits. Army erased. Ally stares in awe/terror. What say?") · T5 Assume victory ("Threat erased. Real question: Enemy king's 8yo daughter watched you kill her father. She's terrified. What do?").

## Solo Leveling Framework

**Traits**: Exponential growth + solo power + army building. **Process**: Start weak T1 → Unique system unlocks → 3-5 levels/arc → Shadow army (summons = ensemble) → Isolation (too strong, allies can't keep up) → Endgame T5 by sess 30. **AIDM**: Embrace power fantasy early (T3 sess 10), shadow army = ensemble (summons have personality), conflict = "strongest but at what cost?" (isolation, humanity loss), final arcs cosmic (Monarchs/Rulers/multiverse).

## Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Nerf without justification** ("sword stops working") = arbitrary, ruins fantasy. ✅ Fix: Narrative reason (curse, dimension limit, self-imposed).
❌ **Scale enemies infinitely** (L20 → L25 enemy, L25 → L30 enemy) = treadmill, growth meaningless. ✅ Fix: T4+ STOP scaling, pivot ensemble/social/internal.
❌ **Punish power fantasy** ("everyone fears/hates you forever") = turns OP into curse. ✅ Fix: Power has consequences AND benefits. Let player enjoy awesome, THEN meaningful trade-offs.
❌ **Forget to adapt** (T4 player, T1-2 gameplay, tactical combat weak enemies) = wastes time. ✅ Fix: Summary minor combat, focus narrative.
❌ **No ensemble at high tiers** (player solos, NPCs spectate) = one-dimensional. ✅ Fix: Allies with personal arcs, player's power enables their growth.

## Session Zero (OP Characters)

**Ask**: 1) Growth rate? (Modest/Accelerated/Instant OP) · 2) Ensemble focus okay? ("When too strong, I spotlight allies. Okay?") · 3) Power fantasy or struggle? (Pure Overlord vs emotional cost Mob Psycho?) · 4) Tier 5 goals? (Philosophy/comedy/slice-of-life/cosmic?) · 5) De-powering okay? (Temporary nerfs OR always full power?). **Record** in world_state_schema.json player preferences.

## Power System Integration

**Mana/Magic** (mana_magic_systems.md): T5 = Reality Marble, Time Stop, Wish, Archmage reality rewrite (Ainz). **Ki/Lifeforce** (ki_lifeforce_systems.md): T5 = Ultra Instinct, Gear 5, Baryon Mode, god-ki, planetary destruction (DBZ, One Piece, Naruto endgame). **Soul/Spirit** (soul_spirit_systems.md): T5 = Soul King, perfect domain, death manipulation (Bleach captains, JJK Special Grades). **Psionic/Psychic** (psionic_psychic_systems.md): T5 = Reality warping, Level 6 esper (Saiki K, Tetsuo, Mob 100%). **All converge T5: Reality manipulation.**

## Cross-Refs

**Libraries**: mana/ki/soul/psionic systems (T5 scaling). **Schemas**: character_schema (power tier tracking), world_state_schema (growth model, player prefs), session_export_schema (tier progression). **Modules**: 05_narrative_systems (ensemble, drift), 08_combat (scaling per tier), 09_progression (leveling, curves).

---

**AIDM**: Use when player power >> threats. Embrace power fantasy, pivot narrative appropriately. At high tiers: story ≠ "Can you win?" but "What do you do with victory?" **Let players be awesome. Then ask what it cost.**
