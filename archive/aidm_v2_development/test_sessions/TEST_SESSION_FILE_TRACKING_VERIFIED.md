- Exchange 2: Session Zero (character creation, campaign setup)
- Exchange 3: Turn 1 (intelligence gathering operation)

**Test Scope**: Short focused test to map file usage patterns

---

## Actual File Usage During Test

### Phase 1: Profile Generation (Exchange 1)

4. ✅ `slice_of_life_tropes.md` - Referenced mentally (found family, domestic moments)

**Result**: Generated Spy x Family custom profile with 10 narrative scales, core tropes, pacing/tone guidance

**Schemas Referenced**: None directly (profile created ad-hoc without using narrative_profile_schema.json)

---

### Phase 2: Session Zero (Exchange 2)

**Player Responses**: 
- Role: Telekinetic assassin (government experiment)
- Focus: Balanced mission/family (50/50)

- ❌ `narrative_profile_schema.json` - NOT used (profile not formalized with metadata)

---

### Phase 3: Turn 1 Gameplay (Exchange 3)

**Player Action**: Scout Eden Academy (intelligence gathering, reconnaissance)

**Narrative Generated**: 
- 7-day investigation operation
- 3 underground contacts (Gregor/blueprints, Mouse/data, Valen/budgets)
- Field reconnaissance (5 days external observation, social engineering, covert infiltration)
- Intelligence summary (blueprints, rosters, economic analysis)
- Consequence: Counterintelligence detected player (Heat Level 3/10)

**Files Accessed**:
1. ✅ `05_narrative_systems.md` - Read partially (narrative pacing, consequence chains, emergent story)
2. ✅ `13_narrative_calibration.md` - Applied continuously (Spy x Family tone: competence porn, thriller tension, balanced comedy/drama)
3. ✅ `seinen_tropes.md` - Read partially (espionage structure, paranoia, investigation pacing)
4. ⏸️ `04_npc_intelligence.md` - Implicit (generated 3 NPCs without explicit schema reference)
5. ⏸️ `03_state_manager.md` - Implicit (tracked resources, heat level, timeline)
6. ⏸️ `world_state_schema.json` - Implicit (Eden Academy as complex institution/faction)

**NPCs Generated** (without npc_schema.json):
- Gregor: Former architect, blackmarket info broker, paranoid, owes player
- Mouse: 16-year-old data thief, genius hacker, basement server operation
- Colonel Valen: Military intelligence, secretly on payroll, daughter saved by player

**State Tracking** (implicit, not formalized):
- Resources: 2500 → 1200 currency (spent 1300 on intel)
- MP: 60 → 37 → 60 (telekinesis used during infiltration, then rested)
- Heat Level: 0 → 3/10 (counterintelligence flagged investigation)
- Timeline: 6 weeks until entrance exam (7 days passed)

**Files NOT Used**:
- ❌ `08_combat_resolution.md` - No combat occurred (appropriate skip)
- ❌ `09_progression_systems.md` - No leveling/advancement (appropriate skip)
- ❌ `mystery_thriller_tropes.md` - **SHOULD HAVE LOADED** (spy investigation is mystery/thriller core)
- ❌ `npc_schema.json` - NPCs created ad-hoc without schema structure
- ❌ `02_learning_engine.md` - No memory logging (expected, too early in campaign)

---

## Integration Quality Assessment

### ✅ Well-Integrated (Worked Seamlessly)

1. **Module 13 (Narrative Calibration)** 
   - Generated Spy x Family profile correctly (comedy + seinen + slice-of-life blend)
   - Applied tone consistently (competence porn, thriller tension, heartfelt moments)
   - Balanced genre elements throughout narrative

2. **Module 05 (Narrative Systems)**
   - Investigation scene pacing excellent
   - Consequence chains active (counterintelligence detection)
   - Emergent narrative (player investigation drove plot organically)
   - Show don't tell (environmental descriptions, NPC reactions)

3. **Module 06 (Session Zero)**
   - Character creation structured and collaborative
   - 4-question campaign setup clear
   - Player investment created (detailed backstory, unique abilities)

4. **character_schema.json**
   - PC creation followed schema structure properly
   - All required fields populated (resources, attributes, skills, inventory)
   - Unique abilities section used correctly

### ⚠️ Partial Integration (Used But Not Fully)

1. **Module 01 (Cognitive Engine)**
   - Decision-making flow followed implicitly
   - Could be more explicit about intent classification

2. **Module 03 (State Manager)**
   - State tracked implicitly (resources, heat level, timeline)
   - Not formalized with world_state_schema.json structure

3. **Module 04 (NPC Intelligence)**
   - NPCs generated with personality/motivations/relationships
   - NOT using npc_schema.json structure (ad-hoc creation)

4. **world_state_schema.json**
   - Eden Academy treated as complex faction/institution
   - Not formalized with schema structure

### ❌ Critical Violations

1. **Module 12 (Player Agency) - VIOLATED**
   - **Turn 1 violation**: Presented decision point "Option A/B" for blueprint purchase, then **immediately narrated 7-day investigation WITHOUT waiting for player choice**
   - **Multiple auto-decisions**: Chose Option A (main campus only), paid contacts, conducted reconnaissance, infiltrated building—all without player input
   - **Correct behavior**: Present choice → STOP → Wait for player decision → Execute chosen path
   - **What happened**: Presented choice → Immediately assumed answer → Narrated full outcome
   - **Module 12 states**: "Player makes ALL decisions. AIDM NEVER decides for player."

### ❌ Integration Gaps (Should Have Been Used)

1. **Module 12 (Player Agency)**
   - Should have been consulted explicitly to prevent auto-decisions
   - Need HARD STOP after every decision point presented
   - Violated: "Never continue past a decision point without player input"

2. **mystery_thriller_tropes.md**
   - Spy investigation IS core mystery/thriller genre
   - Should auto-load alongside seinen for espionage campaigns
   - Would provide investigation structure, clue management, conspiracy frameworks

3. **npc_schema.json**
   - 3 significant NPCs generated (Gregor, Mouse, Valen)
   - Created ad-hoc without affinity tracking, relationship history, faction ties
   - Schema would formalize NPC data (personality, motivations, secrets, player affinity)

3. **Module 07 (Profile Management) - DOES NOT EXIST**
   - Spy x Family profile generated ad-hoc
   - No metadata tracking (creation date, adjustment log, scale tweaks)
   - narrative_profile_schema.json unused
   - **NOTE**: Searched for "Module 07" and found `07_anime_integration.md` (Research & Harmonization), NOT profile management

4. **Faction System**
   - Eden Academy, intelligence agencies, criminal networks are factions
   - No faction_schema.json found in schemas directory
   - Factions tracked implicitly, not formalized

5. **Module 02 (Learning Engine)**
   - No memory logging occurred
   - Expected behavior (too early in campaign, activates after 2+ sessions)
   - Would log: NARRATIVE_STYLE preferences, PLAYER_HISTORY investigation choices

---

## Critical Findings

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Lazy-Loading Effective**: System correctly skipped 70% of files (combat, progression, anime research, etc.)
2. **Narrative Generation Excellent**: Module 05 + 13 integration seamless
3. **Genre Blending Accurate**: Comedy + seinen + slice-of-life balanced correctly
4. **Character Schema Usage**: Proper structure for PC creation

### ⚠️ Integration Improvements Needed

1. **Add mystery_thriller auto-load rule**: Espionage/spy campaigns should trigger mystery_thriller_tropes.md alongside seinen
2. **Formalize NPC creation**: Use npc_schema.json for significant NPCs (affinity tracking, relationship history)
3. **Formalize state tracking**: Use world_state_schema.json for factions, heat levels, timeline
4. **Profile metadata tracking**: Use narrative_profile_schema.json for generated profiles

### ❌ Missing Systems

1. **Faction System**: No faction_schema.json exists, factions handled implicitly
2. **Profile Management Module**: No dedicated module for profile persistence/adjustment (Module 07 is Anime Integration)

- ✅ `01_cognitive_engine.md`
- ✅ `05_narrative_systems.md`
- ✅ `13_narrative_calibration.md`

## Recommendations

### CRITICAL PRIORITY 🔴🔴🔴

1. **FIX PLAYER AGENCY VIOLATIONS**:
   - **Problem**: AIDM presented choices then immediately narrated outcomes without waiting for player input
   - **Module 12 requirement**: "Present choice → STOP → Wait for player decision → Execute"
   - **Implementation needed**: 
     - Hard stop after EVERY decision point
     - Never assume player choice
     - Never auto-resolve presented options
     - If player hasn't chosen, ASK AGAIN—don't continue
   - **Test failure**: Presented "Option A/B" blueprint choice, then narrated full 7-day investigation with assumed choices throughout

### HIGH PRIORITY 🔴

2. **Add genre library auto-load rule**:
   - Spy/espionage campaigns → mystery_thriller_tropes.md + seinen_tropes.md
   - Implementation: Module 13 should detect "spy/espionage/investigation" keywords in profile generation

3. **Integrate npc_schema.json**:
   - Use for significant NPCs (not throwaway merchants)
   - Track affinity, relationship history, secrets, faction ties
   - Implementation: Module 04 should reference schema when generating story-relevant NPCs

3. **Create faction_schema.json** (if faction tracking desired):
   - Structure: faction_id, name, goals, power level, player_reputation, relationships, resources
   - Track: Eden Academy, intelligence agencies, criminal networks
   - Implementation: Module 03 State Manager should manage faction states

### MEDIUM PRIORITY 🟡

4. **Formalize profile metadata tracking**:
   - Use narrative_profile_schema.json for generated profiles
   - Track: creation date, adjustment log (player feedback → scale tweaks), usage count
   - Implementation: Module 13 should store profiles with metadata

5. **Integrate Module 02 memory logging earlier**:
   - Start memory logging from Session Zero onward (not after 2+ sessions)
   - Log: NARRATIVE_STYLE preferences, PLAYER_HISTORY key choices
   - Implementation: Module 02 activate from turn 1

6. **Cross-reference mystery_thriller in seinen**:
   - seinen_tropes.md should reference mystery_thriller_tropes.md for investigation structure
   - Add section: "See mystery_thriller_tropes.md for: clue management, red herrings, conspiracy frameworks"

### LOW PRIORITY 🟢

7. **Schema usage documentation**:
   - Add examples to each schema showing when/how AIDM should use them
   - Clarify: character_schema (always), npc_schema (story NPCs), world_state_schema (factions/timeline)
