# Priority 1 Scaffolding Implementation - COMPLETION SUMMARY

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Duration**: ~8-10 hours total  
**Status**: ✅ **PRIORITY 1 COMPLETE** (All 3 Tasks)

---

## Overview

Successfully implemented **intelligent mechanical scaffolding** for AIDM's narrative profile system, transforming it from isolated narrative calibration into an integrated system that maps narrative DNA to game mechanics.

### What Was Accomplished

**✅ Task 1: Added Scaffolding Rules to Module 13** (~2-3 hours)
- Added "Narrative DNA → Mechanical Scaffolding" section (~1,200 words)
- Created 4 core mapping rules:
  1. **Power Level Mapping**: Power Fantasy scale → Growth model selection
  2. **Progression Pacing**: Fast/Slow scale → XP multiplier
  3. **Combat System**: Tactical scale → Stat framework
  4. **Power System**: Type + Explained scale → Library selection
- Provides intelligent guidance for profile generation

**✅ Task 2: Added Scaffolding Examples to 12 CORE Profiles** (~4-5 hours)
- Added "Mechanical Scaffolding (Reference Implementation)" sections to ALL 12 profiles
- Section sizes: ~1,000-2,500 words per profile (varies by complexity)
- **Total content added**: ~16,000-18,000 words across profiles

**✅ Task 3: Added State Tracking to Module 03** (~2-3 hours)
- Added NARRATIVE_PROFILE component to state architecture (~2,500 words)
- 5th state component tracks: active_profile_id, profile_type, scales (10), tropes (15), adjustments_log, mechanical_scaffolding
- Pre-made profiles: Store ID only (lightweight, reference library files)
- Generated profiles: Store FULL data (critical, no file reference exists)
- Updated validation rules, export/import handling, cross-schema consistency examples
- Ensures generated profiles persist across sessions

## Scaffolding Section Structure (Consistent Across Profiles)

Each profile's scaffolding section includes:

### 1. Power Level Mapping (Module 12)
- **Narrative DNA**: Power Fantasy scale, threat profile, death risk
- **Maps To**: Growth model selection (Instant OP/Accelerated/Modest)
- **Reasoning**: Why this mapping fits the show's philosophy

### 2. Progression Pacing (Module 09)
- **Narrative DNA**: Fast-Paced scale, story structure, "power-up" nature
- **Maps To**: XP model (High/Standard/Low) OR milestone-based
- **Level Expectations**: Session counts for level ranges
- **Reasoning**: How pacing matches narrative tempo

### 3. Combat System (Module 08)
- **Narrative DNA**: Tactical scale, combat style, strategic elements
- **Maps To**: Stat framework (3-stat/6-stat/custom) + special mechanics
- **Attribute Priorities**: Which stats matter most, build paths
- **Combat Narration**: How to describe fights (% tactical vs spectacle vs emotional)
- **Reasoning**: Why this system serves the show's combat philosophy

### 4. Power System Mapping
- **Narrative DNA**: Power type, Explained scale, cost structure
- **Maps To**: Library selection (psionic/ki/soul/mana/custom) + mechanics
- **Resource Mechanics**: MP/SP/AP formulas, costs, recovery
- **Explained Scale Application**: How much to reveal/explain
- **Reasoning**: Why this power system fits

### 5. Attribute Priorities by Archetype
- Multiple build examples from the show
- Primary/Secondary/Dump stats for each archetype
- Build paths showing progression

### 6. Character Creation Notes
- **Recommended Party Composition**: What works for this profile
- **Session Zero Requirements**: MANDATORY discussions before starting
- **Tone Calibration**: How to maintain show's feel
- **Red Flags / Avoid**: Wrong-fit player types
- **Session Structure**: Typical session breakdown

### 7. Scaffolding Summary
- Quick-reference bullet points
- Template use case (what similar anime this applies to)

## Impact on System Architecture

### Before Scaffolding
- Module 13 extracted narrative DNA (10 scales, 15 tropes)
- **BUT** no connection to mechanical systems
- Pre-made profiles were narrative-only descriptions
- AIDM couldn't intelligently generate profiles

### After Scaffolding
- ✅ Module 13 now includes mapping rules
- ✅ Pre-made profiles show example mapping decisions
- ✅ AIDM can reference patterns when generating new profiles
- ✅ Narrative DNA → Mechanics connection established

### Flow Example (Chainsaw Man - NOT in library)
```
Player: "I want Chainsaw Man vibes!"

BEFORE Scaffolding:
→ Module 07 research Chainsaw Man
→ Module 13 extract scales (Fast-Paced 3/10, Tactical 5/10, etc.)
→ ??? (no guidance on mechanics)
→ GM picks systems arbitrarily

AFTER Scaffolding:
→ Module 07 research Chainsaw Man
→ Module 13 extract scales (Fast-Paced 3/10, Power Fantasy 5/10, Tactical 5/10, Soul-based powers)
→ REFERENCE DanDaDan/JJK scaffolding (similar chaos, soul systems)
→ MAP: Fast 3/10 → High XP, Tactical 5/10 → 6-stat, Soul powers → soul_spirit_systems.md
→ GENERATE profile with mechanical scaffolding
→ GM has coherent system matching Chainsaw Man's vibe
```

## Next Steps

### ⏳ Priority 1 Task 3 (PENDING - 2-3 hours)
**Add narrative profile state tracking to Module 03**:
- Track active_profile_id
- Track profile_type (pre-made vs generated)
- Track narrative scales (10 values)
- Track enabled tropes (15 switches)
- Track adjustments_log (player preferences over time)
- Track mechanical_scaffolding (applied mappings)
- **CRITICAL**: Generated profiles must store FULL data (can't reference files like pre-made)
- Include in export/import schema
- Validate on session restart

### Priority 2 (4-6 hours)
1. **Add NARRATIVE_STYLE memory category to Module 02**
   - Store narrative profile adjustments during play
   - Track player preferences ("more comedy", "less tactical")
   - Referenced by Module 03 state for persistence

2. **Document cognitive engine narrative flow (Module 01)**
   - How cognitive engine uses narrative profile during gameplay
   - Flow: State loads profile → Module 13 calibrates → Module 06 narrates → Module 02 stores
   - Include examples

3. **Cross-link genre libraries ↔ profiles**
   - Update shounen_action.md, isekai.md, psychological.md
   - Reference profiles using those tropes (shounen → DanDaDan/HxH/JJK)
   - Improve discoverability

### Priority 3 (14-20 hours)
1. **Create 6 missing genre tropes libraries** (8-12 hours)
   - seinen.md, shoujo.md, mecha.md, sports.md, thriller.md, slice_of_life.md
   - Each ~3K-5K words, 10-15 tropes, cross-reference profiles

2. **Test intelligent profile generation** (4-6 hours)
   - Generate 3 new profiles: Chainsaw Man, Frieren, Spy x Family
   - Validate mapping rules work
   - Ensure generated profiles include full scaffolding

3. **Update EXPANSION_ROADMAP** (2 hours)
   - Revise with scaffolding architecture
   - Phase 4: Generate 100+ profiles (not manual creation)

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Incremental Implementation**: Completing Module 13 first, then profiles in batches (2-3 at a time)
2. **Consistent Structure**: Using same section format across all profiles enabled pattern recognition
3. **Word Count Targets**: ~1,000-2,500 words per profile kept scaffolding comprehensive but not overwhelming
4. **Example Variety**: 12 diverse profiles (tactical masterclass HxH, zero combat Death Note, sports Haikyuu, historical Vinland Saga) provide templates for wide range of anime

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Profile Diversity**: Each anime required unique scaffolding (Death Note's "no combat" vs HxH's "complex Nen" vs Haikyuu's "sports system")
2. **Depth Balance**: Needed enough detail to be useful templates, but not so prescriptive as to become rules
3. **Time Management**: Task 2 took longer than estimated (4-5 hours vs 2-3 hours planned) due to profile complexity

### Recommendations for Future Work
1. **State Tracking is Critical**: Complete Task 3 BEFORE Priority 2 (generated profiles can't persist without it)
2. **Test Generation Early**: Don't wait until Priority 3 to test—validate mapping rules work with 1-2 generated profiles
3. **Genre Library Priority**: Seinen library most critical (Berserk, Vinland Saga, Chainsaw Man patterns needed)
